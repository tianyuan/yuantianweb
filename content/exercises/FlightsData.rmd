## Harvesting the Flight Data  from <https://flightaware.com/>

Step 1: Get all the flight number

1. Use `Dest_ICAO` and `Source_ICAO` to get all the flight numbers between two airports: <https://flightaware.com/live/findflight?origin=CYXE&destination=CYYZ>
 * `Dest_ICAO` and `Source_ICAO` are 4-digit airports ID

2. Register a free acount with FlightAware, then you will have access to 90 day history of a flight. 
 * E.g., get 80-day history of a specific flight number `WJA506`.  <https://flightaware.com/live/flight/WJA506/history/80>
