              due to a new corona virus made the headlines all over the world.
              Exponential growth in the number of those affected makes this
              virus such a threat. The current meta-analysis aimed to estimate
              the prevalence of underlying disorders in hospitalized COVID-19
              patients. Methods: A comprehensive systematic search was
              performed on PubMed, Scopus, Web of science, and Google scholar,
              to find articles published until 15 February 2020. All relevant
              articles that reported clinical characteristics and
              epidemiological information of hospitalized COVID-19 patients
              were included in the analysis. Results: The data of 76993
              patients presented in 10 articles were included in this study.
              According to the meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence of
              hypertension, cardiovascular disease, smoking history and
              diabetes in people infected with SARS-CoV-2 were estimated as
              16.37\% (95\%CI: 10.15\%-23.65\%), 12.11\% (95\%CI
              4.40\%-22.75\%), 7.63\% (95\%CI 3.83\%-12.43\%) and 7.87\%

              the findings of the present study, hypertension, cardiovascular
              diseases, diabetes mellitus, smoking, chronic obstructive
              pulmonary disease (COPD), malignancy, and chronic kidney disease

  abstract    = "We develop a multi-risk SIR model (MR-SIR) where infection,
                 hospitalization and fatality rates vary between groups---in
                 particular between the ``young'', ``the middle-aged'' and the
                 ``old''. Our MR-SIR model enables a tractable quantitative
                 analysis of optimal policy similar to those already developed
                 in the context of the homogeneous-agent SIR models. For
                 baseline parameter values for the COVID-19 pandemic applied to
                 the US, we find that optimal policies differentially targeting
                 risk/age groups significantly outperform optimal uniform
                 policies and most of the gains can be realized by having
                 stricter lockdown policies on the oldest group. For example,
                 for the same economic cost (24.3\% decline in GDP), optimal
                 semi--targeted or fully-targeted policies reduce mortality
                 from 1.83\% to 0.71\% (thus, saving 2.7 million lives)
                 relative to optimal uniform policies. Intuitively, a strict
                 and long lockdown for the most vulnerable group both reduces
                 infections and enables less strict lockdowns for the
                 lower-risk groups. We also study the impacts of social
                 distancing, the matching technology, the expected arrival time
                 of a vaccine, and testing with or without tracing on optimal
                 policies. Overall, targeted policies that are combined with
                 measures that reduce interactions between groups and increase
                 testing and isolation of the infected can minimize both
                 economic losses and deaths in our model.",

              understanding of the transmission dynamics is important for the
              development and evaluation of effective control policies.
              Objective: To delineate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and
              evaluate the transmission risk at different exposure window
              periods before and after symptom onset. Design, Setting, and
              Participants: This prospective case-ascertained study in Taiwan
              included laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 and their
              contacts. The study period was from January 15 to March 18, 2020.
              All close contacts were quarantined at home for 14 days after
              their last exposure to the index case. During the quarantine
              period, any relevant symptoms (fever, cough, or other respiratory
              symptoms) of contacts triggered a COVID-19 test. The final
              follow-up date was April 2, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures:
              Secondary clinical attack rate (considering symptomatic cases
              only) for different exposure time windows of the index cases and
              for different exposure settings (such as household, family, and
              health care). Results: We enrolled 100 confirmed patients, with a
              median age of 44 years (range, 11-88 years), including 56 men and
              44 women. Among their 2761 close contacts, there were 22 paired
              index-secondary cases. The overall secondary clinical attack rate
              was 0.7\% (95\% CI, 0.4\%-1.0\%). The attack rate was higher
              among the 1818 contacts whose exposure to index cases started
              within 5 days of symptom onset (1.0\% [95\% CI, 0.6\%-1.6\%])
              compared with those who were exposed later (0 cases from 852
              contacts; 95\% CI, 0\%-0.4\%). The 299 contacts with exclusive
              presymptomatic exposures were also at risk (attack rate, 0.7\%
              [95\% CI, 0.2\%-2.4\%]). The attack rate was higher among
              household (4.6\% [95\% CI, 2.3\%-9.3\%]) and nonhousehold (5.3\%
              [95\% CI, 2.1\%-12.8\%]) family contacts than that in health care
              or other settings. The attack rates were higher among those aged
              40 to 59 years (1.1\% [95\% CI, 0.6\%-2.1\%]) and those aged 60
              years and older (0.9\% [95\% CI, 0.3\%-2.6\%]). Conclusions and
              Relevance: In this study, high transmissibility of COVID-19
              before and immediately after symptom onset suggests that finding
              and isolating symptomatic patients alone may not suffice to
              contain the epidemic, and more generalized measures may be
              required, such as social distancing.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome
              coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, prompted heightened
              surveillance in Shenzhen, China. The resulting data provide a
              rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course,
              transmission, and the impact of control measures. METHODS: From
              Jan 14 to Feb 12, 2020, the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control
              and Prevention identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases and 1286 close
              contacts. We compared cases identified through symptomatic
              surveillance and contact tracing, and estimated the time from
              symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and admission to
              hospital. We estimated metrics of disease transmission and
              analysed factors influencing transmission risk. FINDINGS: Cases
              were older than the general population (mean age 45 years) and
              balanced between males (n=187) and females (n=204). 356 (91\%) of
              391 cases had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial
              assessment. As of Feb 22, 2020, three cases had died and 225 had
              recovered (median time to recovery 21 days; 95\% CI 20-22). Cases
              were isolated on average 4·6 days (95\% CI 4·1-5·0) after
              developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1·9 days
              (95\% CI 1·1-2·7). Household contacts and those travelling with a
              case were at higher risk of infection (odds ratio 6·27 [95\% CI
              1·49-26·33] for household contacts and 7·06 [1·43-34·91] for
              those travelling with a case) than other close contacts. The
              household secondary attack rate was 11·2\% (95\% CI 9·1-13·8),
              and children were as likely to be infected as adults (infection
              rate 7·4\% in children <10 years vs population average of 6·6\%).
              The observed reproductive number (R) was 0·4 (95\% CI 0·3-0·5),
              with a mean serial interval of 6·3 days (95\% CI 5·2-7·6).
              INTERPRETATION: Our data on cases as well as their infected and
              uninfected close contacts provide key insights into the
              epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. This analysis shows that isolation
              and contact tracing reduce the time during which cases are
              infectious in the community, thereby reducing the R. The overall
              impact of isolation and contact tracing, however, is uncertain
              and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases.
              Moreover, children are at a similar risk of infection to the
              general population, although less likely to have severe symptoms;
              hence they should be considered in analyses of transmission and
              control. FUNDING: Emergency Response Program of Harbin Institute

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: The Public Health Agency of Canada's Canadian
              Chronic Disease Surveillance System (CCDSS) uses a validated,
              standardized methodology to estimate prevalence of individual
              chronic diseases, such as diabetes. Expansion of the CCDSS for
              surveillance of multimorbidity, the co-occurrence of two or more
              chronic diseases, could better inform health promotion and
              disease prevention. The objective of this study was to assess the
              feasibility of using the CCDSS to estimate multimorbidity
              prevalence. METHODS: We used administrative health data from
              seven provinces and three territories and five validated chronic
              conditions (i.e. cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease,
              mental illness, hypertension and diabetes) to estimate
              multimorbidity prevalence. We produced age-standardized (using
              Canada's 1991 population) and age-specific estimates for two
              multimorbidity definitions: (1) two or more conditions, and (2)
              three or more conditions from the five validated conditions, by
              sex, fiscal year and geography. RESULTS: Among Canadians aged 40
              years and over in the fiscal year 2011/12, the prevalence of two
              or more and three or more chronic conditions was 26.5\% and
              10.2\%, respectively, which is comparable to other estimates
              based on administrative health data. The increase in
              multimorbidity prevalence with increasing age was similar across
              provinces. The difference in prevalence for males and females
              varied by province and territory. We observed substantial
              variation in estimates over time. Results were consistent for the
              two definitions of multimorbidity. CONCLUSION: The CCDSS
              methodology can produce comparative estimates of multimorbidity
              prevalence across provinces and territories, but there are
              challenges in using it to estimate temporal trends. Further
              expansion of the CCDSS in the number and breadth of validated
              case definitions will improve the accuracy of multimorbidity
              surveillance for the Canadian population.",

              clinical and laboratory parameters were collected prospectively
              from a cohort of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were
              hospitalised to Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, Wuhan City, Hubei
              Province, China, between December 25, 2019 and February 7, 2020.
              Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed to
              investigate the relationship between each variable and the risk
              for death of COVID-19 pneumonia patients.A total of 179 patients
              with COVID-19 pneumonia (97 male and 82 female) were included in
              the present prospective study, of whom 21 died. Univariate and

              Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic (1). As of March
              28, 2020, a total of 571,678 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 26,494
              deaths have been reported worldwide (2). Reports from China and
              Italy suggest that risk factors for severe disease include older
              age and the presence of at least one of several underlying health
              conditions (3,4). U.S. older adults, including those aged
              $\geq$65 years and particularly those aged $\geq$85 years, also
              appear to be at higher risk for severe COVID-19-associated
              outcomes; however, data describing underlying health conditions
              among U.S. COVID-19 patients have not yet been reported (5). As
              of March 28, 2020, U.S. states and territories have reported
              122,653 U.S. COVID-19 cases to CDC, including 7,162 (5.8\%) for
              whom data on underlying health conditions and other known risk
              factors for severe outcomes from respiratory infections were

              one or more underlying health condition or risk factor, and 4,470
              (62.4\%) had none of these conditions reported. The percentage of
              COVID-19 patients with at least one underlying health condition
              or risk factor was higher among those requiring intensive care
              unit (ICU) admission (358 of 457, 78\%) and those requiring

              mellitus, chronic lung disease, and cardiovascular disease. These

              with underlying health conditions or other recognized risk
              factors for severe outcomes from respiratory infections appear to

                 the COVID-19 outbreak is quintessential for modelling studies
                 and guiding intervention strategies. Whereas different
                 estimates for the incubation period distribution and the
                 serial interval distribution have been reported, estimates of
                 the generation interval for COVID-19 have not been provided.
                 Methods: We used outbreak data from clusters in Singapore and
                 Tianjin, China to estimate the generation interval from
                 symptom onset data while acknowledging uncertainty about the
                 incubation period distribution and the underlying transmission
                 network. From those estimates we obtained the proportions
                 pre-symptomatic transmission and reproduction numbers.
                 Results: The mean generation interval was 5.20 (95\%CI
                 3.78-6.78) days for Singapore and 3.95 (95\%CI 3.01-4.91) days
                 for Tianjin, China when relying on a previously reported
                 incubation period with mean 5.2 and SD 2.8 days. The
                 proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was 48\% (95\%CI
                 32-67\%) for Singapore and 62\% (95\%CI 50-76\%) for Tianjin,
                 China. Estimates of the reproduction number based on the
                 generation interval distribution were slightly higher than
                 those based on the serial interval distribution. Conclusions:
                 Estimating generation and serial interval distributions from
                 outbreak data requires careful investigation of the underlying
                 transmission network. Detailed contact tracing information is
                 essential for correctly estimating these quantities.",

              assessed by calculating a set of transmissibility parameters, the
              most important being the reproduction number (R), which is
              defined as the average number of secondary cases generated per
              typical infectious case. METHODS: We conducted a systematic
              review to summarize published estimates of R for pandemic or
              seasonal influenza and for novel influenza viruses (e.g. H5N1).
              We retained and summarized papers that estimated R for pandemic
              or seasonal influenza or for human infections with novel
              influenza viruses. RESULTS: The search yielded 567 papers.
              Ninety-one papers were retained, and an additional twenty papers
              were identified from the references of the retained papers.
              Twenty-four studies reported 51 R values for the 1918 pandemic.
              The median R value for 1918 was 1.80 (interquartile range [IQR]:
              1.47-2.27). Six studies reported seven 1957 pandemic R values.
              The median R value for 1957 was 1.65 (IQR: 1.53-1.70). Four
              studies reported seven 1968 pandemic R values. The median R value
              for 1968 was 1.80 (IQR: 1.56-1.85). Fifty-seven studies reported
              78 2009 pandemic R values. The median R value for 2009 was 1.46
              (IQR: 1.30-1.70) and was similar across the two waves of illness:
              1.46 for the first wave and 1.48 for the second wave. Twenty-four
              studies reported 47 seasonal epidemic R values. The median R
              value for seasonal influenza was 1.28 (IQR: 1.19-1.37). Four
              studies reported six novel influenza R values. Four out of six R
              values were <1. CONCLUSIONS: These R values represent the
              difference between epidemics that are controllable and cause
              moderate illness and those causing a significant number of
              illnesses and requiring intensive mitigation strategies to
              control. Continued monitoring of R during seasonal and novel
              influenza outbreaks is needed to document its variation before
              the next pandemic.",

                 Vo, a small town near Padua, died of pneumonia due to
                 SARS-CoV-2 infection. This was the first COVID-19 death
                 detected in Italy since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the
                 Chinese city of Wuhan, Hubei province. In response, the
                 regional authorities imposed the lockdown of the whole
                 municipality for 14 days. We collected information on the
                 demography, clinical presentation, hospitalization, contact
                 network and presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in nasopharyngeal
                 swabs for 85.9\% and 71.5\% of the population of Vo at two
                 consecutive time points. On the first survey, which was

                 a prevalence of infection of 2.6\% (95\% confidence interval
                 (CI) 2.1-3.3\%). On the second survey, which was conducted at
                 the end of the lockdown, we found a prevalence of 1.2\% (95\%
                 CI 0.8-1.8\%). Notably, 43.2\% (95\% CI 32.2-54.7\%) of the
                 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections detected across the two
                 surveys were asymptomatic. The mean serial interval was 6.9
                 days (95\% CI 2.6-13.4). We found no statistically significant
                 difference in the viral load (as measured by genome
                 equivalents inferred from cycle threshold data) of symptomatic
                 versus asymptomatic infections (p-values 0.6 and 0.2 for E and

                 Contact tracing of the newly infected cases and transmission

              disease 2019 (Covid-19) was first diagnosed in Iceland at the end
              of February. However, data are limited on how SARS-CoV-2, the
              virus that causes Covid-19, enters and spreads in a population.
              METHODS: We targeted testing to persons living in Iceland who
              were at high risk for infection (mainly those who were
              symptomatic, had recently traveled to high-risk countries, or had
              contact with infected persons). We also carried out population
              screening using two strategies: issuing an open invitation to
              10,797 persons and sending random invitations to 2283 persons. We
              sequenced SARS-CoV-2 from 643 samples. RESULTS: As of April 4, a
              total of 1221 of 9199 persons (13.3\%) who were recruited for
              targeted testing had positive results for infection with
              SARS-CoV-2. Of those tested in the general population, 87 (0.8\%)
              in the open-invitation screening and 13 (0.6\%) in the
              random-population screening tested positive for the virus. In
              total, 6\% of the population was screened. Most persons in the
              targeted-testing group who received positive tests early in the
              study had recently traveled internationally, in contrast to those
              who tested positive later in the study. Children under 10 years
              of age were less likely to receive a positive result than were
              persons 10 years of age or older, with percentages of 6.7\% and
              13.7\%, respectively, for targeted testing; in the population
              screening, no child under 10 years of age had a positive result,
              as compared with 0.8\% of those 10 years of age or older. Fewer
              females than males received positive results both in targeted
              testing (11.0\% vs. 16.7\%) and in population screening (0.6\%
              vs. 0.9\%). The haplotypes of the sequenced SARS-CoV-2 viruses
              were diverse and changed over time. The percentage of infected
              participants that was determined through population screening
              remained stable for the 20-day duration of screening.
              CONCLUSIONS: In a population-based study in Iceland, children
              under 10 years of age and females had a lower incidence of
              SARS-CoV-2 infection than adolescents or adults and males. The
              proportion of infected persons identified through population
              screening did not change substantially during the screening
              period, which was consistent with a beneficial effect of
              containment efforts. (Funded by deCODE Genetics-Amgen.).",

              challenges hospital leaders to make time-sensitive, critical
              decisions about clinical operations and resource allocations.
              Objective: To estimate the timing of surges in clinical demand
              and the best- and worst-case scenarios of local COVID-19-induced
              strain on hospital capacity, and thus inform clinical operations
              and staffing demands and identify when hospital capacity would be
              saturated. Design: Monte Carlo simulation instantiation of a
              susceptible, infected, removed (SIR) model with a 1-day cycle.
              Setting: 3 hospitals in an academic health system. Patients: All
              people living in the greater Philadelphia region. Measurements:
              The COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model (CHIME)
              (http://penn-chime.phl.io) SIR model was used to estimate the
              time from 23 March 2020 until hospital capacity would probably be
              exceeded, and the intensity of the surge, including for intensive
              care unit (ICU) beds and ventilators. Results: Using patients
              with COVID-19 alone, CHIME estimated that it would be 31 to 53
              days before demand exceeds existing hospital capacity. In best-
              and worst-case scenarios of surges in the number of patients with
              COVID-19, the needed total capacity for hospital beds would reach
              3131 to 12 650 across the 3 hospitals, including 338 to 1608 ICU
              beds and 118 to 599 ventilators. Limitations: Model parameters
              were taken directly or derived from published data across
              heterogeneous populations and practice environments and from the
              health system's historical data. CHIME does not incorporate more

              study, individual-level data on 32 583 laboratory-confirmed
              COVID-19 cases reported between December 8, 2019, and March 8,
              2020, were extracted from the municipal Notifiable Disease Report

              of cases per day per million people), across age, sex, and
              geographic locations were calculated across 5 periods: December 8
              to January 9 (no intervention), January 10 to 22 (massive human

              courses3. This severe presentation corresponds to the usage of a
              virus receptor that is expressed predominantly in the lung2,4. By
              causing an early onset of severe symptoms, this same receptor
              tropism is thought to have determined pathogenicity, but also

              analysis of nine cases, providing proof of active virus
              replication in upper respiratory tract tissues. Pharyngeal virus
              shedding was very high during the first week of symptoms (peak at
              7.11 $\times$ 108 RNA copies per throat swab, day 4). Infectious
              virus was readily isolated from throat- and lung-derived samples,
              but not from stool samples, in spite of high virus RNA
              concentration. Blood and urine never yielded virus. Active
              replication in the throat was confirmed by viral replicative RNA
              intermediates in throat samples. Sequence-distinct virus
              populations were consistently detected in throat and lung samples
              from the same patient, proving independent replication. Shedding
              of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms.
              Seroconversion occurred after 7 days in 50\% of patients (14 days
              in all), but was not followed by a rapid decline in viral load.
              COVID-19 can present as a mild upper respiratory tract illness.

              diseases such as SARS, HIV, TB and smallpox, a summary parameter,
              the basic reproduction number R(0), is generally calculated from
              a population-level model. R(0) specifies the average number of
              secondary infections caused by one infected individual during
              his/her entire infectious period at the start of an outbreak.
              R(0) is used to assess the severity of the outbreak, as well as
              the strength of the medical and/or behavioral interventions
              necessary for control. Conventionally, it is assumed that if
              R(0)>1 the outbreak generates an epidemic, and if R(0)<1 the
              outbreak becomes extinct. Here, we use computational and
              analytical methods to calculate the average number of secondary
              infections and to show that it does not necessarily represent an
              epidemic threshold parameter (as it has been generally assumed).
              Previously we have constructed a new type of individual-level
              model (ILM) and linked it with a population-level model. Our ILM
              generates the same temporal incidence and prevalence patterns as
              the population-level model; we use our ILM to directly calculate
              the average number of secondary infections (i.e., R(0)).
              Surprisingly, we find that this value of R(0) calculated from the
              ILM is very different from the epidemic threshold calculated from
              the population-level model. This occurs because many different
              individual-level processes can generate the same incidence and
              prevalence patterns. We show that obtaining R(0) from empirical
              contact tracing data collected by epidemiologists and using this
              R(0) as a threshold parameter for a population-level model could
              produce extremely misleading estimates of the infectiousness of
              the pathogen, the severity of an outbreak, and the strength of
              the medical and/or behavioral interventions necessary for

                   reproduce several characteristics of COVID-19 transmission,
                   accounting for its reproductive number, the length of
                   incubation and generation periods, age-dependent attack
                   rates, and the growth rate of cumulative incidence during a
                   sustained and unmitigated local transmission. An important
                   calibration outcome is the age-dependent fraction of
                   symptomatic cases, with this fraction for children found to
                   be one-fifth of such fraction for adults. We then apply the
                   model to compare several intervention strategies, including

                   social distancing with varying levels of compliance, and

               (COVID-19) cases in Canada may create substantial demand for
               hospital admission and critical care. We evaluated the extent to
               which self-isolation of mildly ill people delays the peak of
               outbreaks and reduces the need for this care in each Canadian
               province.Methods: We developed a computational model and
               simulated scenarios for COVID-19 outbreaks within each province.
               Using estimates of COVID-19 characteristics, we projected the
               hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) bed requirements without
               self-isolation, assuming an average number of 2.5 secondary
               cases, and compared scenarios in which different proportions of
               mildly ill people practised self-isolation 24 hours after
               symptom onset.Results: Without self-isolation, the peak of
               outbreaks would occur in the first half of June, and an average
               of 569 ICU bed days per 10 000 population would be needed. When
               20\% of cases practised self-isolation, the peak was delayed by
               2--4 weeks, and ICU bed requirement was reduced by 23.5\%
               compared with no self-isolation. Increasing self-isolation to
               40\% reduced ICU use by 53.6\% and delayed the peak of infection
               by an additional 2--4 weeks. Assuming current ICU bed occupancy
               rates above 80\% and self-isolation of 40\%, demand would still
               exceed available (unoccupied) ICU bed capacity.Interpretation:
               At the peak of COVID-19 outbreaks, the need for ICU beds will
               exceed the total number of ICU beds even with self-isolation at
               40\%. Our results show the coming challenge for the health care

               Canada to slow the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome

               We evaluated how different nonpharmaceutical interventions could
               be used to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
               pandemic and reduce the burden on the health care
               system.Methods: We used an age-structured compartmental model of
               COVID-19 transmission in the population of Ontario, Canada. We
               compared a base case with limited testing, isolation and
               quarantine to scenarios with the following: enhanced case
               finding, restrictive physical-distancing measures, or a
               combination of enhanced case finding and less restrictive
               physical distancing. Interventions were either implemented for
               fixed durations or dynamically cycled on and off, based on
               projected occupancy of intensive care unit (ICU) beds. We
               present medians and credible intervals from 100 replicates per
               scenario using a 2-year time horizon.Results: We estimated that
               56\% (95\% credible interval 42\%--63\%) of the Ontario
               population would be infected over the course of the epidemic in
               the base case. At the epidemic peak, we projected 107 000 (95\%
               credible interval 60 760--149 000) cases in hospital (non-ICU)
               and 55 500 (95\% credible interval 32 700--75 200) cases in ICU.
               For fixed-duration scenarios, all interventions were projected
               to delay and reduce the height of the epidemic peak relative to
               the base case, with restrictive physical distancing estimated to
               have the greatest effect. Longer duration interventions were
               more effective. Dynamic interventions were projected to reduce
               the proportion of the population infected at the end of the
               2-year period and could reduce the median number of cases in ICU
               below current estimates of Ontario's ICU
               capacity.Interpretation: Without substantial physical distancing
               or a combination of moderate physical distancing with enhanced
               case finding, we project that ICU resources would be
               overwhelmed. Dynamic physical distancing could maintain

               andeconomic respite for populations.",

              is common epidemiological practice to estimate the case fatality
              risk, defined as the risk of death among cases. However, there
              are three technical obstacles that should be addressed to
              appropriately measure this risk. First, division of the
              cumulative number of deaths by that of cases tends to
              underestimate the actual risk because deaths that will occur have
              not yet observed, and so the delay in time from illness onset to
              death must be addressed. Second, the observed dataset of reported
              cases represents only a proportion of all infected individuals
              and there can be a substantial number of asymptomatic and mildly
              infected individuals who are never diagnosed. Third,
              ascertainment bias and risk of death among all those infected
              would be smaller when estimated using shorter virus detection
              windows and less sensitive diagnostic laboratory tests. In the
              ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, health authorities must cope with the
              uncertainty in the risk of death from COVID-19, and high-risk
              individuals should be identified using approaches that can
              address the abovementioned three problems. Although COVID-19
              involves mostly mild infections among the majority of the general
              population, the risk of death among young adults is higher than
              that of seasonal influenza, and elderly with underlying

              (COVID-19) identified on Jan 20, 2020, in South Korea, the number
              of cases rapidly increased, resulting in 6284 cases including 42
              deaths as of Mar 6, 2020. To examine the growth rate of the
              outbreak, we present the first study to report the reproduction
              number of COVID-19 in South Korea. METHODS: The daily confirmed
              cases of COVID-19 in South Korea were extracted from publicly
              available sources. By using the empirical reporting delay
              distribution and simulating the generalized growth model, we
              estimated the effective reproduction number based on the
              discretized probability distribution of the generation interval.
              RESULTS: We identified four major clusters and estimated the
              reproduction number at 1.5 (95\% CI: 1.4-1.6). In addition, the
              intrinsic growth rate was estimated at 0.6 (95\% CI: 0.6, 0.7),
              and the scaling of growth parameter was estimated at 0.8 (95\%
              CI: 0.7, 0.8), indicating sub-exponential growth dynamics of
              COVID-19. The crude case fatality rate is higher among males
              (1.1\%) compared to females (0.4\%) and increases with older age.
              CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate an early sustained transmission

              at higher risk for severe COVID-19-associated illness and death

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Communicable disease outbreaks of novel or existing
              pathogens threaten human health around the globe. It would be
              desirable to rapidly characterize such outbreaks and develop
              accurate projections of their duration and cumulative size even
              when limited preliminary data are available. Here we develop a
              mathematical model to aid public health authorities in tracking
              the expansion and contraction of outbreaks with explicit
              representation of factors (other than population immunity) that
              may slow epidemic growth. METHODOLOGY: The Incidence Decay and
              Exponential Adjustment (IDEA) model is a parsimonious function
              that uses the basic reproduction number R0, along with a
              discounting factor to project the growth of outbreaks using only
              basic epidemiological information (e.g., daily incidence counts).
              PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Compared to simulated data, IDEA provides
              highly accurate estimates of total size and duration for a given
              outbreak when R0 is low or moderate, and also identifies turning
              points or new waves. When tested with an outbreak of pandemic
              influenza A (H1N1), the model generates estimated incidence at
              the i+1(th) serial interval using data from the i(th) serial
              interval within an average of 20\% of actual incidence.
              CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: This model for communicable disease
              outbreaks provides rapid assessments of outbreak growth and
              public health interventions. Further evaluation in the context of
              real-world outbreaks will establish the utility of IDEA as a tool

              long-term care skilled nursing facility (SNF) in King County,
              Washington that was first identified on February 28, 2020,
              highlighted the potential for rapid spread among residents of
              these types of facilities (2). On March 1, a health care provider
              at a second long-term care skilled nursing facility (facility A)
              in King County, Washington, had a positive test result for
              SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, after
              working while symptomatic on February 26 and 28. By March 6,
              seven residents of this second facility were symptomatic and had
              positive test results for SARS-CoV-2. On March 13, CDC performed
              symptom assessments and SARS-CoV-2 testing for 76 (93\%) of the
              82 facility A residents to evaluate the utility of symptom
              screening for identification of COVID-19 in SNF residents.
              Residents were categorized as asymptomatic or symptomatic at the
              time of testing, based on the absence or presence of fever,
              cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms on the day of
              testing or during the preceding 14 days. Among 23 (30\%)
              residents with positive test results, 10 (43\%) had symptoms on
              the date of testing, and 13 (57\%) were asymptomatic. Seven days
              after testing, 10 of these 13 previously asymptomatic residents
              had developed symptoms and were recategorized as presymptomatic
              at the time of testing. The reverse transcription-polymerase
              chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing cycle threshold (Ct) values
              indicated large quantities of viral RNA in asymptomatic,
              presymptomatic, and symptomatic residents, suggesting the
              potential for transmission regardless of symptoms. Symptom-based
              screening in SNFs could fail to identify approximately half of
              residents with COVID-19. Long-term care facilities should take
              proactive steps to prevent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 (3). Once a

               (TB), the disease remains stubbornly persistent, having infected
               one third of the world population, and causing more than 1.5
               million deaths annually. To better understand the epidemiology
               of TB, past modeling efforts have sought to understand how TB
               prevention and control policies affect infection spread in the

               contact tracing dynamics, the model supports investigation of
               how TB outcomes are affected by changes to the breadth and
               timeliness of contact investigation. Model results suggest that
               while successful contact tracing is self-limiting, it plays a
               critical role in TB control. Results also suggest that expanded
               breadth of contact tracing offers diminishing returns, and
               underscores the desirability of highly targeted contact tracing

  abstract = "Tuberculosis (TB) is a potentially fatal disease spread by an
              airborne pathogen infecting approximately one third of the globe.
              For decades, contact tracing (CT) has served a key role in the
              control of TB and many other notifiable communicable diseases.
              Unfortunately, CT is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process
              and is often conducted by a small and overworked nursing staff.
              To help improve the effectiveness of CT, we introduce a detailed,
              individual-based model of CT for the Canadian province of
              Saskatchewan. The model captures the detailed operation of TB CT,
              including loss to follow-up, and prophylactic and case treatment.
              This representation is used to assess the impact on active TB
              cases and TB infection prevalence of differential scoping, speed,
              prioritization of the CT process, and reduced loss to follow-up.
              Scenario results are broadly consistent with--but provide many
              additional insights beyond--our previously reported findings
              using an aggregate model. In the context of a stylized northern
              community, findings suggest that age- and ethnicity-prioritized
              schemes could improve CT effectiveness compared to unprioritized
              schemes by dramatically reducing TB infection and preventing on
              average roughly 11\% (p < .0001) of active TB cases over a period
              of 20 years. Reducing loss to follow-up to 10\% could yield 5.4\%
              (p = .02) TB cases prevented on average with lower prevalence of
              TB infection, but improving the CT speed does not yield
              significant improvement in TB outcomes. Finally, although the
              work emphasized the value of social network analysis, we found
              that caution should be exercised in directly translating social
              network analysis-observed associations into prioritization

              (SARS-CoV-2) has already taken on pandemic proportions, affecting
              over 100 countries in a matter of weeks. A global response to
              prepare health systems worldwide is imperative. Although
              containment measures in China have reduced new cases by more than
              90\%, this reduction is not the case elsewhere, and Italy has
              been particularly affected. There is now grave concern regarding
              the Italian national health system's capacity to effectively
              respond to the needs of patients who are infected and require
              intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The percentage of
              patients in intensive care reported daily in Italy between March
              1 and March 11, 2020, has consistently been between 9\% and 11\%
              of patients who are actively infected. The number of patients
              infected since Feb 21 in Italy closely follows an exponential
              trend. If this trend continues for 1 more week, there will be 30
              000 infected patients. Intensive care units will then be at
              maximum capacity; up to 4000 hospital beds will be needed by
              mid-April, 2020. Our analysis might help political leaders and
              health authorities to allocate enough resources, including
              personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the
              situation in the next few days and weeks. If the Italian outbreak
              follows a similar trend as in Hubei province, China, the number
              of newly infected patients could start to decrease within 3-4
              days, departing from the exponential trend. However, this cannot
              currently be predicted because of differences between social

              facilities in China.",

              control outbreaks of infectious diseases, and has been used for
              coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Whether this strategy will
              achieve control depends on characteristics of both the pathogen
              and the response. Here we use a mathematical model to assess if
              isolation and contact tracing are able to control onwards
              transmission from imported cases of COVID-19. METHODS: We
              developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the
              COVID-19 outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential
              effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at
              controlling a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
              (SARS-CoV-2)-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied
              in the number of initial cases, the basic reproduction number
              (R0), the delay from symptom onset to isolation, the probability
              that contacts were traced, the proportion of transmission that
              occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical
              infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further
              transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if
              transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total.
              We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation
              and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of
              cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort.
              FINDINGS: Simulated outbreaks starting with five initial cases,
              an R0 of 1·5, and 0\% transmission before symptom onset could be
              controlled even with low contact tracing probability; however,
              the probability of controlling an outbreak decreased with the
              number of initial cases, when R0 was 2·5 or 3·5 and with more
              transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial
              numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R0 of 1·5
              were controllable with less than 50\% of contacts successfully
              traced. To control the majority of outbreaks, for R0 of 2·5 more
              than 70\% of contacts had to be traced, and for an R0 of 3·5 more
              than 90\% of contacts had to be traced. The delay between symptom
              onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether
              an outbreak was controllable when R0 was 1·5. For R0 values of
              2·5 or 3·5, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and
              isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1\% of
              transmission occurred before symptom onset. INTERPRETATION: In
              most scenarios, highly effective contact tracing and case
              isolation is enough to control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within
              3 months. The probability of control decreases with long delays
              from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by
              contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms.
              This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission
              characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control
              to assess the potential success of local response efforts.

              estimate transmissibility parameters during outbreaks was carried
              out. Most methods used the epidemic curve and the generation time
              distribution. Two categories of methods were available: those
              estimating the initial reproduction number, and those estimating
              a time dependent reproduction number. We implemented five methods

              school closure on influenza outbreaks as predicted by simulation
              studies. METHODS: We searched Medline and Embase for relevant
              modelling studies published by the end of October 2012, and
              handsearched key journals. We summarised the predicted effects of
              school closure on the peak and cumulative attack rates and the
              duration of the epidemic. We investigated how these predictions
              depended on the basic reproduction number, the timing and
              duration of closure and the assumed effects of school closures on
              contact patterns. RESULTS: School closures were usually predicted
              to be most effective if they caused large reductions in contact,
              if transmissibility was low (e.g. a basic reproduction number
              90\% reductions or even increases under certain assumptions).
              This partly reflected differences in model assumptions, such as
              those regarding population contact patterns. CONCLUSIONS:
              Simulation studies suggest that school closure can be a useful
              control measure during an influenza pandemic, particularly for
              reducing peak demand on health services. However, it is difficult
              to accurately quantify the likely benefits. Further studies of

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Social distancing is one of the community mitigation
              measures that may be recommended during influenza pandemics.
              Social distancing can reduce virus transmission by increasing
              physical distance or reducing frequency of congregation in
              socially dense community settings, such as schools or workplaces.
              We conducted a systematic review to assess the evidence that
              social distancing in non-healthcare workplaces reduces or slows
              influenza transmission. METHODS: Electronic searches were
              conducted using MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library,
              PsycINFO, CINAHL, NIOSHTIC-2, and EconLit to identify studies
              published in English from January 1, 2000, through May 3, 2017.
              Data extraction was done by two reviewers independently. A
              narrative synthesis was performed. RESULTS: Fifteen studies,
              representing 12 modeling and three epidemiological, met the
              eligibility criteria. The epidemiological studies showed that
              social distancing was associated with a reduction in
              influenza-like illness and seroconversion to 2009 influenza A
              (H1N1). However, the overall risk of bias in the epidemiological
              studies was serious. The modeling studies estimated that
              workplace social distancing measures alone produced a median
              reduction of 23\% in the cumulative influenza attack rate in the
              general population. It also delayed and reduced the peak
              influenza attack rate. The reduction in the cumulative attack
              rate was more pronounced when workplace social distancing was
              combined with other nonpharmaceutical or pharmaceutical
              interventions. However, the effectiveness was estimated to
              decline with higher basic reproduction number values, delayed
              triggering of workplace social distancing, or lower compliance.
              CONCLUSIONS: Modeling studies support social distancing in
              non-healthcare workplaces, but there is a paucity of

              severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in
              December, 2019, in Wuhan, China. Information about critically ill
              patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce. We aimed to
              describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill
              patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. METHODS: In this
              single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled
              52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who
              were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin
              Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and
              Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values,
              comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all
              collected. Data were compared between survivors and
              non-survivors. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of
              Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of
              SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and
              the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.
              FINDINGS: Of 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52
              critically ill adult patients were included. The mean age of the
              52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67\%) were men, 21
              (40\%) had chronic illness, 51 (98\%) had fever. 32 (61·5\%)
              patients had died at 28 days, and the median duration from
              admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) to death was 7 (IQR
              3-11) days for non-survivors. Compared with survivors,
              non-survivors were older (64·6 years [11·2] vs 51·9 years
              [12·9]), more likely to develop ARDS (26 [81\%] patients vs 9
              [45\%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical
              ventilation (30 [94\%] patients vs 7 [35\%] patients), either
              invasively or non-invasively. Most patients had organ function
              damage, including 35 (67\%) with ARDS, 15 (29\%) with acute
              kidney injury, 12 (23\%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29\%) with
              liver dysfunction, and one (2\%) with pneumothorax. 37 (71\%)
              patients required mechanical ventilation. Hospital-acquired
              infection occurred in seven (13·5\%) patients. INTERPRETATION:
              The mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2
              pneumonia is considerable. The survival time of the non-survivors
              is likely to be within 1-2 weeks after ICU admission. Older
              patients (>65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased
              risk of death. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great

                 determine the transmission and the effort required to control

                 interval distribution for transmission clusters in Singapore
                 and in Tianjin. We infer the basic reproduction number and
                 identify the extent of pre-symptomatic transmission. Methods:
                 We collected outbreak information from Singapore and Tianjin,
                 China, reported from Jan.19-Feb.26 and Jan.21-Feb.27,
                 respectively. We estimated incubation periods and serial
                 intervals in both populations. Results: The mean incubation
                 period was 7.1 (6.13, 8.25) days for Singapore and 9 (7.92,
                 10.2)days for Tianjin. Both datasets had shorter incubation
                 periods for earlier-occurring cases. The mean serial interval
                 was 4.56 (2.69, 6.42) days for Singapore and 4.22 (3.43, 5.01)
                 for Tianjin. We inferred that early in the outbreaks,
                 infection was transmitted on average 2.55 and 2.89days before
                 symptom onset (Singapore, Tianjin). The estimated basic
                 reproduction number for Singapore was 1.97 (1.45, 2.48)
                 secondary cases per infective; for Tianjin it was 1.87
                 (1.65,2.09) secondary cases per infective. Conclusions:
                 Estimated serial intervals are shorter than incubation periods
                 in both Singapore and Tianjin, suggesting that pre-symptomatic
                 transmission is occurring. Shorter serial intervals lead to
                 lower estimates of R0, which suggest that half of all
                 secondary infections should be prevented to control spread.",

              The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the
              clinical characteristics of affected patients is limited.
              Objective: To describe the epidemiological and clinical
              characteristics of NCIP. Design, Setting, and Participants:
              Retrospective, single-center case series of the 138 consecutive
              hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP at Zhongnan Hospital of
              Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 28,
              2020; final date of follow-up was February 3, 2020. Exposures:
              Documented NCIP. Main Outcomes and Measures: Epidemiological,
              demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment
              data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of critically ill
              patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. Presumed
              hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of
              health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards
              became infected and a possible source of infection could be
              tracked. Results: Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the
              median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92
              years) and 75 (54.3\%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission
              was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected
              health professionals (40 [29\%]) and hospitalized patients (17
              [12.3\%]). Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6\%]), fatigue
              (96 [69.6\%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4\%]). Lymphopenia
              (lymphocyte count, 0.8 $\times$ 109/L [interquartile range
              \{IQR\}, 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3\%), prolonged
              prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients
              (58\%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR,
              182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9\%). Chest computed tomographic
              scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in
              the lungs of all patients. Most patients received antiviral
              therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9\%]), and many received
              antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4\%]; ceftriaxone, 34
              [24.6\%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1\%]) and glucocorticoid therapy
              (62 [44.9\%]). Thirty-six patients (26.1\%) were transferred to
              the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including
              acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1\%]), arrhythmia (16
              [44.4\%]), and shock (11 [30.6\%]). The median time from first
              symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0
              days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the ICU (n =
              36), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n = 102),
              were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely
              to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2\%] vs 38 [37.3\%]),
              and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9\%] vs 20
              [19.6\%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7\%] vs 31 [30.4\%]). Of the 36
              cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1\%) received high-flow oxygen therapy,
              15 (41.7\%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2\%)
              received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal
              membrane oxygenation). As of February 3, 47 patients (34.1\%)
              were discharged and 6 died (overall mortality, 4.3\%), but the
              remaining patients are still hospitalized. Among those discharged
              alive (n = 47), the median hospital stay was 10 days (IQR,
              7.0-14.0). Conclusions and Relevance: In this single-center case
              series of 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP in Wuhan,
              China, presumed hospital-related transmission of 2019-nCoV was
              suspected in 41\% of patients, 26\% of patients received ICU
              care, and mortality was 4.3\%.",

              respiratory tract infections in humans. Human-to-human
              transmissions have been described with incubation times between
              2-10 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated
              hands or surfaces. We therefore reviewed the literature on all
              available information about the persistence of human and
              veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well as
              inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical
              disinfection, e.g. in healthcare facilities. The analysis of 22
              studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute
              Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory
              Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV)
              can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic

              December 2019. There is limited support for many of its key

              clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), which has
              important implications for surveillance and control activities.
              Objective: To estimate the length of the incubation period of
              COVID-19 and describe its public health implications. Design:
              Pooled analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between 4
              January 2020 and 24 February 2020. Setting: News reports and
              press releases from 50 provinces, regions, and countries outside
              Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Participants: Persons with
              confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside Hubei province, China.
              Measurements: Patient demographic characteristics and dates and
              times of possible exposure, symptom onset, fever onset, and
              hospitalization. Results: There were 181 confirmed cases with
              identifiable exposure and symptom onset windows to estimate the
              incubation period of COVID-19. The median incubation period was
              estimated to be 5.1 days (95\% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5\%
              of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI,
              8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection. These estimates imply that, under
              conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10 000 cases (99th
              percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days of active
              monitoring or quarantine. Limitation: Publicly reported cases may
              overrepresent severe cases, the incubation period for which may
              differ from that of mild cases. Conclusion: This work provides
              additional evidence for a median incubation period for COVID-19
              of approximately 5 days, similar to SARS. Our results support
              current proposals for the length of quarantine or active
              monitoring of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2, although
              longer monitoring periods might be justified in extreme cases.

              (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan city and rapidly spread throughout
              China, data have been needed on the clinical characteristics of
              the affected patients. METHODS: We extracted data regarding 1099
              patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in
              30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in China
              through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was
              admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical
              ventilation, or death. RESULTS: The median age of the patients
              was 47 years; 41.9\% of the patients were female. The primary
              composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1\%), including
              5.0\% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3\% who underwent invasive
              mechanical ventilation, and 1.4\% who died. Only 1.9\% of the
              patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife. Among
              nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3\% had contact with residents of
              Wuhan, including 31.3\% who had visited the city. The most common
              symptoms were fever (43.8\% on admission and 88.7\% during
              hospitalization) and cough (67.8\%). Diarrhea was uncommon
              (3.8\%). The median incubation period was 4 days (interquartile
              range, 2 to 7). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most
              common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT)
              (56.4\%). No radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of
              877 patients (17.9\%) with nonsevere disease and in 5 of 173
              patients (2.9\%) with severe disease. Lymphocytopenia was present

                 the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the epidemic
                 in Wuhan, China. METHODS Individual-level data on 25,961
                 laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases reported through February
                 18, 2020 were extracted from the municipal Notifiable Disease
                 Report System. Based on key events and interventions, we
                 divided the epidemic into four periods: before January 11,
                 January 11-22, January 23 - February 1, and February 2-18. We
                 compared epidemiological characteristics across periods and
                 different demographic groups. We developed a
                 susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to study the
                 epidemic and evaluate the impact of interventions. RESULTS The
                 median age of the cases was 57 years and 50.3\% were women.
                 The attack rate peaked in the third period and substantially
                 declined afterwards across geographic regions, sex and age
                 groups, except for children (age <20) whose attack rate
                 continued to increase. Healthcare workers and elderly people
                 had higher attack rates and severity risk increased with age.
                 The effective reproductive number dropped from 3.86 (95\%
                 credible interval 3.74 to 3.97) before interventions to 0.32
                 (0.28 to 0.37) post interventions. The interventions were
                 estimated to prevent 94.5\% (93.7 to 95.2\%) infections till
                 February 18. We found that at least 59\% of infected cases
                 were unascertained in Wuhan, potentially including
                 asymptomatic and mild-symptomatic cases. CONCLUSIONS
                 Considerable countermeasures have effectively controlled the
                 Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan. Special efforts are needed to
                 protect vulnerable populations, including healthcare workers,

              conclusions; however, the literature does suggest that patients
              who LWBS have conditions of lower urgency and lower acuity, are
              more likely to be male and younger, and are likely to identify
              prolonged waiting times as a central concern. LWBS patients
              generally have very low rates of subsequent admission, and
              reports of serious adverse events are rare. Many LWBS patients go
              on to seek alternative medical attention, and they might have
              higher rates of ongoing symptoms at follow-up. Further research

              seen and their reasons, to clarify if such behaviour poses a
              health risk, to analyse the impact initiatives have made on the

              implications of using it as a national performance indicator
              within the NHS. METHODS: A combination of data sources was
              reviewed: a 'realistic' literature review, analysis of hospital
              episode statistics data from England and a local NHS trust audit.
              MAJOR FINDINGS: LWBS rates vary across the world, from 15\% to
              0.36\%. Also initiatives to reduce LWBS rates demonstrated mixed
              outcomes, with reductions in the rate by as much as 96\%, while
              others were ineffective. The most common reason quoted for LWBS
              was long waiting times and there were few data to suggest LWBS
              posed a risk to patient health. CONCLUSIONS: LWBS is an issue
              experienced in many countries that has responded in a varying
              manner to many initiatives in attempts to reduce it; however, it
              is clearly associated with the waiting times experienced in ED

              would assess the effect of waiting times from another

              before physician's visit (LWBS) or during treatment (LDT)
              represent a useful indicator of the emergency care's quality. The
              profile of patients LWBS was described: they are generally males,
              young, with lower urgency triage allocation and longer waiting
              time. They have a greater risk of ED re-admission compared to
              discharged patients, but effect on hospitalization and mortality
              are more controversial. The aims of this study are to identify
              determinants and adverse short term outcomes for LWBS and LDT
              patients. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study that
              include all ED visits of LWBS, LDT and discharged patients in
              2015 in the Lazio region, Central Italy. Determinants of LWBS or
              LDT were selected from gender, age, citizenship, residence area,
              triage category, chronic comorbidities, number of uncompleted ED
              visit in the previous year, mode of arrival in ED, time-band, day
              of the week, waiting time and ED crowding, using a multi-level
              logistic regression. A multivariate logistic regression was used
              to test if LWBS or LDT have a greater risk of short term adverse
              outcome compared to discharged patients. RESULTS: The cohort
              consists in 835,440 visits in ED, 86.8\% subjects visited and
              discharged, 8.9\% subjects are LWBS patients and 4.3\% LDT. LWBS
              and LDT patients are mainly young, males, with a less severe
              triage, with long waiting times in ED. Moreover, ED crowding and
              leaving ED before physician's visit in the previous year are risk
              factors of self-discharging. LWBS and LDT patients have a higher
              risk of readmission (LWBS: OR = 4.63, 95\%CI 4.5-4.7; OR = 2.89,
              95\%CI 2.8-2.9; LDT: OR = 3.12, 95\%CI 3-3.2; OR = 2.25,
              95\%CI2.2-2.3 for readmissions within 2 and 7 days respectively)
              and hospitalization (LWBS: OR = 3.65, 95\%CI 3.4-3.9; OR = 2.25,
              95\%CI 2.1-2.4; LDT: OR = 3.96, 95\%CI 3.6-4.3; OR = 2.62, 95\%CI
              2.4-2.8 for hospitalization within 2 and 7 days respectively).
              Furthermore, we find a mortality excess of risk for LWBS patients
              compared to the reference group (OR = 2.56, 95\%CI1.6-4.2; OR =
              1.7, 95\%CI 1.3-2.2 within 2 and 7 days respectively).
              CONCLUSIONS: Determinants of LWBS confirmed what already known,
              but LDT patients should be further investigated. There could be
              adverse health effects for people with LWBS and LDT behaviour.

              Purpose To investigate the diagnostic value and consistency of
              chest CT as compared with comparison to RT-PCR assay in COVID-19.
              Methods From January 6 to February 6, 2020, 1014 patients in
              Wuhan, China who underwent both chest CT and RT-PCR tests were
              included. With RT-PCR as reference standard, the performance of
              chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19 was assessed. Besides, for
              patients with multiple RT-PCR assays, the dynamic conversion of
              RT-PCR results (negative to positive, positive to negative,
              respectively) was analyzed as compared with serial chest CT scans
              for those with time-interval of 4 days or more. Results Of 1014
              patients, 59\% (601/1014) had positive RT-PCR results, and 88\%
              (888/1014) had positive chest CT scans. The sensitivity of chest
              CT in suggesting COVID-19 was 97\% (95\%CI, 95-98\%, 580/601
              patients) based on positive RT-PCR results. In patients with
              negative RT-PCR results, 75\% (308/413) had positive chest CT
              findings; of 308, 48\% were considered as highly likely cases,
              with 33\% as probable cases. By analysis of serial RT-PCR assays
              and CT scans, the mean interval time between the initial negative
              to positive RT-PCR results was 5.1 $\pm$ 1.5 days; the initial
              positive to subsequent negative RT-PCR result was 6.9 $\pm$ 2.3
              days). 60\% to 93\% of cases had initial positive CT consistent
              with COVID-19 prior (or parallel) to the initial positive RT-PCR
              results. 42\% (24/57) cases showed improvement in follow-up chest
              CT scans before the RT-PCR results turning negative. Conclusion
              Chest CT has a high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19. Chest

               The exponential increase of the confirmed number of cases of
               2019n-CoV is of great concern to the global community. The fears
               and panic among residents in the epicenters have prompted
               diverse responses, which are understudied. During such a crisis,
               community trust and support for the government and health
               authorities are important to contain the outbreak. We aimed to
               investigate the influence of institutional trust on public

               Internet-based, cross-sectional survey was administered on
               January 29, 2020. The study population comprised all residents

               provision and preventive instructions, individual preventive
               behaviors and treatment-seeking behaviors were queried. Findings
               The majority of the participants expressed a great extent of
               trust in the information and preventive instructions provided by
               the central government than by the local government. A high
               uptake of 2019-nCoV preventive measures was found, particularly
               among people who had been placed under quarantine. Being under
               quarantine (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.35, 95\% confidence

               and significant determinants of higher preventive behavior
               scores. The majority of study participants (85.7\%, n = 3,640)
               reported that they would seek hospital treatment if they
               suspected themselves to have been infected with 2019 n-CoV. Few
               of the participants from Wuhan (16.6\%, n = 475) and those
               participants who were under quarantine (13.8\%, n = 550)
               expressed an unwillingness to seek hospital treatment.
               Similarly, being under quarantine (OR = 2.36, 95\% CI 1.80 to
               3.09) and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.20,
               95\% CI 1.96 to 2.49) were two strong significant determinants
               of hospital treatment-seeking. Interpretation The results of
               this study suggest that institutional trust is an important
               factor influencing adequate preventive behavior and seeking
               formal medical care during an outbreak. In view of the 2019-nCoV
               being highly pathogenic and extremely contagious, our findings
               also underscore the importance of public health intervention to
               reach individuals with poor adherence to preventive measures and
               who are reluctant to seek treatment at formal health services.

              appear to affect the IPI season (p = 0.49). Specifically, the
              influenza peak never preceded the IPI peak. CONCLUSION: On a

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: In late December, 2019, patients presenting with
              viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were
              reported in Wuhan, China. A novel coronavirus was subsequently
              identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019
              novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000
              cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which
              involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human
              transmission has been confirmed. METHODS: We did next-generation
              sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and
              cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited
              the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Complete and partial
              2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals.
              Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain
              the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by
              rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Phylogenetic analysis of these
              2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to
              determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer
              its likely origin. Homology modelling was done to explore the
              likely receptor-binding properties of the virus. FINDINGS: The
              ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients
              were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98\% sequence
              identity. Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88\%
              identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome
              (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21,
              collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more
              distant from SARS-CoV (about 79\%) and MERS-CoV (about 50\%).
              Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the
              subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a
              relatively long branch length to its closest relatives
              bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct
              from SARS-CoV. Notably, homology modelling revealed that
              2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that
              of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues.
              INTERPRETATION: 2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV
              to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus. Although
              our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the
              original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market
              in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the
              emergence of the virus in humans. Importantly, structural
              analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the
              angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans. The future
              evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent
              investigation. FUNDING: National Key Research and Development

              2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emerged in Wuhan, China. We
              aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical
              characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. METHODS: In this
              retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed
              cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan
              20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were
              analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and
              radiological features and laboratory data. Outcomes were followed
              up until Jan 25, 2020. FINDINGS: Of the 99 patients with
              2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49\%) had a history of exposure to the
              Huanan seafood market. The average age of the patients was 55·5
              years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women. 2019-nCoV was
              detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR. 50 (51\%) patients
              had chronic diseases. Patients had clinical manifestations of
              fever (82 [83\%] patients), cough (81 [82\%] patients), shortness
              of breath (31 [31\%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11\%] patients),
              confusion (nine [9\%] patients), headache (eight [8\%] patients),
              sore throat (five [5\%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4\%]
              patients), chest pain (two [2\%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2\%]
              patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1\%] patient). According
              to imaging examination, 74 (75\%) patients showed bilateral
              pneumonia, 14 (14\%) patients showed multiple mottling and
              ground-glass opacity, and one (1\%) patient had pneumothorax. 17
              (17\%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome
              and, among them, 11 (11\%) patients worsened in a short period of
              time and died of multiple organ failure. INTERPRETATION: The
              2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to
              affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe
              and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory
              distress syndrome. In general, characteristics of patients who
              died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model
              for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia. Further
              investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the
              MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV

              outcomes of these patients. METHODS: All patients with suspected
              2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We
              prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with
              laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and

              myalgia or fatigue (18 [44\%]); less common symptoms were sputum
              production (11 [28\%] of 39), headache (three [8\%] of 38),
              haemoptysis (two [5\%] of 39), and diarrhoea (one [3\%] of 38).
              Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55\%) of 40 patients (median time from
              illness onset to dyspnoea 8·0 days [IQR 5·0-13·0]). 26 (63\%) of
              41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with
              abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute
              respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29\%]), RNAaemia (six [15\%]),
              acute cardiac injury (five [12\%]) and secondary infection (four
              [10\%]). 13 (32\%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six
              (15\%) died. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had
              higher plasma levels of IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A,
              and TNF$\alpha$. INTERPRETATION: The 2019-nCoV infection caused
              clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute
              respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU
              admission and high mortality. Major gaps in our knowledge of the
              origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and
              clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a
              novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province,
              China. Affected patients were geographically linked with a local
              wet market as a potential source. No data on person-to-person or
              nosocomial transmission have been published to date. METHODS: In
              this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory,
              radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a
              family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after
              returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit
              to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to
              Wuhan. Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these
              patients were done. FINDINGS: From Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a
              family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen
              between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who
              travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the
              novel coronavirus. Additionally, one family member, who did not
              travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several
              days of contact with four of the family members. None of the
              family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals,
              although two had visited a Wuhan hospital. Five family members
              (aged 36-66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower
              respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of
              these 3-6 days after exposure. They presented to our hospital
              (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6-10
              days after symptom onset. They and one asymptomatic child (aged
              10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities. Older
              patients (aged >60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive
              radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia,
              thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate
              dehydrogenase levels. The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these
              six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by
              point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults
              and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the
              internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein
              of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger
              sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR
              amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing
              showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the
              bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses
              found in Chinese horseshoe bats. INTERPRETATION: Our findings are
              consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel
              coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of
              infected travellers in other geographical regions. FUNDING: The

              and countries. We present estimates of the basic reproduction
              number,R0, of 2019-nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak.
              METHODS: Accounting for the impact of the variations in disease
              reporting rate, we modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases
              time series, in mainland China from January 10 to January 24,
              2020, through the exponential growth. With the estimated
              intrinsic growth rate ($\gamma$), we estimated R0 by using the
              serial intervals (SI) of two other well-known coronavirus
              diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations for the true unknown
              SI. FINDINGS: The early outbreak data largely follows the
              exponential growth. We estimated that the meanR0 ranges from 2.24
              (95\%CI: 1.96-2.55) to 3.58 (95\%CI: 2.89-4.39) associated with
              8-fold to 2-fold increase in the reporting rate. We demonstrated
              that changes in reporting rate substantially affect estimates of
              R0. CONCLUSION: The mean estimate ofR0 for the 2019-nCoV ranges
              from 2.24 to 3.58, and significantly larger than 1. Our findings

               (MERS-CoV) was first identified in humans in 2012. A systematic
               literature review was conducted to synthesize current knowledge
               and identify critical knowledge gaps. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
               conducted a systematic review on MERS-CoV using PRISMA
               guidelines. We identified 407 relevant, peer-reviewed
               publications and selected 208 of these based on their
               contributions to four key areas: virology; clinical
               characteristics, outcomes, therapeutic and preventive options;
               epidemiology and transmission; and animal interface and the
               search for natural hosts of MERS-CoV. RESULTS: Dipeptidyl
               peptidase 4 (DPP4/CD26) was identified as the human receptor for
               MERS-CoV, and a variety of molecular and serological assays
               developed. Dromedary camels remain the only documented zoonotic
               source of human infection, but MERS-like CoVs have been detected
               in bat species globally, as well as in dromedary camels
               throughout the Middle East and Africa. However, despite evidence
               of camel-to-human MERS-CoV transmission and cases apparently
               related to camel contact, the source of many primary cases
               remains unknown. There have been sustained health
               care-associated human outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and South Korea,
               the latter originating from one traveler returning from the
               Middle East. Transmission mechanisms are poorly understood; for
               health care, this may include environmental contamination.
               Various potential therapeutics have been identified, but not yet
               evaluated in human clinical trials. At least one candidate
               vaccine has progressed to Phase I trials. CONCLUSIONS: There has
               been substantial MERS-CoV research since 2012, but significant
               knowledge gaps persist, especially in epidemiology and natural
               history of the infection. There have been few rigorous studies
               of baseline prevalence, transmission, and spectrum of disease.
               Terms such as ``camel exposure'' and the epidemiological
               relationships of cases should be clearly defined and
               standardized. We strongly recommend a shared and accessible
               registry or database. Coronaviruses will likely continue to

              contribute to admission bottlenecks, overcrowding, and increased
              length of stay (LOS). In January 2012, the discharge before noon
              (DBN) percentage on 2 medical units was 7\%, below the
              organizational goal of 30\%. OBJECTIVE: To sustainably achieve a
              DBN rate of 30\% and to evaluate the effect of this intervention
              on observed-to-expected (O/E) LOS and 30-day readmission rate.
              DESIGN: Pre-/post-intervention retrospective analysis. SETTING:
              Two acute care inpatient medical units in an urban, academic
              medical center. PATIENTS: All inpatients discharged from the
              units. INTERVENTION: All staff helped create a checklist of daily
              responsibilities at a DBN kickoff event. We initiated afternoon
              interdisciplinary rounds to identify next-day DBNs and created a
              website for enhanced communication. We provided daily feedback on
              the DBN percentage, rewards for success, and real-time
              opportunities for case review. MEASUREMENTS: Calendar month DBN
              percentage, O/E LOS, and 30-day readmission rate. RESULTS: The
              DBN percentage increased from 11\% in the 8-month baseline period
              to an average of 38\% over the 13-month intervention (P =
              0.0002). The average discharge time moved 1 hour and 31 minutes
              earlier in the day. The O/E LOS declined from 1.06 to 0.96 (P =
              0.0001), and the 30-day readmission rate declined from 14.3\% to
              13.1\% (P = 0.1902). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that
              increased DBN is an achievable and sustainable goal for
              hospitals. Future work will allow for better understanding of the
              full effects of such an intervention on patient outcomes and

  abstract = "Objective: Laboratory tests are an important contributor to
              treatment decisions in the emergency department (ED). Rapid
              turnaround of laboratory tests can optimize ED throughout by
              reducing the length of stay (LOS) and improving patient outcomes.
              Despite evidence supporting the effect of shorter turnaround time
              (TAT) on LOS and outcomes, there is still a lack of large
              retrospective studies examining these associations. Here, we
              evaluated the effect of a reduction in laboratory TAT on ED LOS
              using retrospective analysis of Electronic Health Records (EHR).
              Materials and methods: Retrospective analysis of ED encounters
              from a large, US-based, de-identified EHR database and a separate
              analysis of ED encounters from the EHR of an ED at a top-tier
              tertiary care center were performed. Additionally, an efficiency
              model calculating the cumulative potential LOS time savings and
              resulting financial opportunity due to laboratory TAT reduction
              was created, assuming other factors affecting LOS are constant.
              Results: Multivariate regression analysis of patients from the
              multisite study showed that a 1-minute decrease in laboratory TAT
              was associated with 0.50 minutes of decrease in LOS. The
              single-site analysis confirmed our findings from the multisite
              analysis that a positive correlation between laboratory TAT and
              ED LOS exists in the ED population as a whole, as well as across
              different patient acuity levels. In addition, based on the
              calculations from the efficiency model, for a 5-, 10- and
              15-minute TAT reduction, the single-site ED can potentially admit
              a total of 127, 256 and 386 additional patients, respectively,
              annually. Conclusion: A positive correlation between laboratory
              TAT and ED LOS was observed in a broad patient population and

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: The objective was to examine the relationship between
              laboratory testing (including test volume and turnaround time
              [TAT]) and emergency department (ED) length of stay (LOS), using
              linked patient-level data from four hospitals across 4 years.
              METHODS: This was a retrospective, multisite cohort study of
              patients presenting to any one of four EDs in New South Wales,
              Australia, during a 2-month period (August and September) in
              2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011. Data from ED information systems were
              linked to laboratory test data. A cross-classified random-effect
              modeling approach was applied to identify factors affecting ED
              LOS, taking into account the correlation between patients'
              presentations at the same hospital and/or in the same calendar
              year. Number of test order episodes (tests ordered at one point
              in time during the ED stay) and TAT (time from laboratory order
              receipt to result available) were examined. RESULTS: As the
              number of test order episodes increased, so did the duration of
              patient ED LOS (p < 0.0001). For every five additional tests
              ordered per test order episode, the median ED LOS increased by 10
              minutes (2.9\%, p < 0.0001); each 30-minute increase in TAT was,
              on average, associated with a 5.1\% (17 minutes; p < 0.0001)
              increase in ED LOS, after adjustment for other factors. Patients
              presenting to the ED at night (7 p.m. to 7 a.m.) had longer stays
              than those presenting during the daytime, although the median
              TATs at nights were shorter than those during the daytime.
              CONCLUSIONS: Laboratory testing has a direct effect on patients'
              LOS in ED. Laboratory TAT, number of testing episodes, and test
              volume influence ED LOS. Targeted increases of ED resources and
              staffing after-hours may also contribute to reductions in ED LOS.",

  abstract     = "I am collaborating with a number of folks who think a lot
                  about palliative or supportive care for people who are facing
                  end-stage disease, such as advanced dementia, cancer, COPD,
                  or congestive heart failure. A major concern for this
                  population (which really includes just about everyone at some
                  point) is the quality of life at the end of life and what
                  kind of experiences, including interactions with the health
                  care system, they have (and don't have) before death. A key
                  challenge for researchers is figuring out how to analyze
                  events that occur just before death. For example, it is not
                  unusual to consider hospitalization in the week or month
                  before death as a poor outcome. For example, here is a paper
                  in the Journal of Palliative Care Medicine that describes an
                  association of homecare nursing and reduced hospitalizations
                  in the week before death. While there is no denying the
                  strength of the association, it is less clear how much of
                  that association is causal. In particular, there is the
                  possibility of selection bias that may be result when
                  considering only patients who have died. In this post, I want
                  to describe the concept of selection bias and simulate data
                  that mimics the process of end-stage disease in order to
                  explore how these issues might play out when we are actually
                  evaluating the causal effect of an exposure or randomized
                  intervention. Selection bias Selection bias is used to refer
                  to different concepts by different researchers (see this
                  article by Haneuse or this one by Hern{\'a}n et al for really
                  nice discussions of these issues). The terminology doesn't
                  matter as much as understanding the underlying data
                  generating processes that distinguish the different ideas.
                  The key issue is to understand what is being selected. In one
                  case, the exposure or intervention is the focus. And in the
                  second case, it is how the patients or subjects are selected
                  into the study more generally that induces the bias. The
                  first selection process is typically referred to by
                  epidemiologists as confounding bias (though it is also called
                  treatment-selection bias), while the second is actually
                  selection bias. When I've written about these issues before
                  (for example, see here), I've described how DAGs can be
                  useful to illuminate the potential biases. Below, I have
                  drawn a diagram to represent a simple case of selection bias.
                  Say we are interested in measuring the causal relationship
                  between income and blood pressure in some population in which
                  the two are actually not causally related. If people with
                  higher income are more likely to visit a doctor, and if
                  people with higher blood pressure are also more likely to
                  visit a doctor, the underlying causal relationship might be
                  well represented by the DAG on the left in the figure below.
                  Let's say we recruit participants for our study right outside
                  of a medical facility. Choosing this location (as opposed to,
                  say, a shopping mall where the causal model on the left would
                  not be relevant), we are inducing a relationship between
                  income and blood pressure. This can be seen in the DAG on the
                  right, where we have effectively ``controlled'' for medical
                  facility access in our selection process. The induced
                  statistical relationship can be described in this way: if
                  someone is at the medical center and they have relatively low
                  income, they are more likely to have relatively high blood
                  pressure. Conversely, if someone is there and they have
                  relatively low blood pressure, they are more likely to have
                  relatively high income. Based on this logic, we would expect
                  to see a negative relationship between income and blood
                  pressure in our study sample drawn from patients visiting a
                  medical facility. To explore by simulation, we can generate a
                  large population of individuals with uncorrelated income and
                  blood pressure. Selection will be a function of both: n =
                  5000 set.seed(748347) income",

              primary health care, and their potential contributions on quality
              and safety. DATA SOURCES: 25 electronic databases, scanning
              reference lists of articles and consultation with experts in the
              field. We searched publications in English after 1999, but a
              search of the German language literature for a specific model
              type was also undertaken. The grey literature was explored
              through a hand search of the medical trade press and websites of
              relevant national and international clearing houses and
              professional or industry bodies. 11 software packages commonly
              used in Australian general practice were reviewed for any
              potential contribution to clinical governance. STUDY SELECTION:
              19 high-quality studies that assessed outcomes were included.
              DATA EXTRACTION: All abstracts were screened by one researcher,
              and 10\% were screened by a second researcher to crosscheck
              screening quality. Studies were reviewed and coded by four
              reviewers, with all studies being rated using standard critical
              appraisal tools such as the Strengthening the Reporting of
              Observational Studies in Epidemiology checklist. Two researchers
              reviewed the Australian general practice software. Interviews
              were conducted with 16 informants representing service, regional
              primary health care, national and international perspectives.
              DATA SYNTHESIS: Most evidence supports governance models which
              use targeted, peer-led feedback on the clinician's own practice.
              Strategies most used in clinical governance models were audit,
              performance against indicators, and peer-led reflection on
              evidence or performance. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence base for
              clinical governance is fragmented, and focuses mainly on process
              rather than outcomes. Few publications address models that
              enhance safety, efficiency, sustainability and the economics of
              primary health care. Locally relevant clinical indicators, the
              use of computerised medical record systems, regional primary
              health care organisations that have the capacity to support the
              uptake of clinical governance at the practice level, and learning

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: To fulfil its role of coordinating health care,
              primary health care needs to be well integrated, internally and
              with other health and related services. In Australia, primary
              health care services are divided between public and private
              sectors, are responsible to different levels of government and
              work under a variety of funding arrangements, with no overarching
              policy to provide a common frame of reference for their
              activities. DESCRIPTION OF POLICY: Over the past decade,
              coordination of service provision has been improved by changes to
              the funding of private medical and allied health services for
              chronic conditions, by the development in some states of
              voluntary networks of services and by local initiatives, although
              these have had little impact on coordination of planning.
              Integrated primary health care centres are being established
              nationally and in some states, but these are too recent for their
              impact to be assessed. Reforms being considered by the federal
              government include bringing primary health care under one level
              of government with a national primary health care policy,
              establishing regional organisations to coordinate health
              planning, trialling voluntary registration of patients with
              general practices and reforming funding systems. If adopted,
              these could greatly improve integration within primary health
              care. DISCUSSION: Careful change management and realistic
              expectations will be needed. Also other challenges remain, in
              particular the need for developing a more population and
              community oriented primary health care.",

              important now, and what one particular example - Primary Care
              Partnerships - is addressing. The second is to analyse the
              network structure of two of these partnerships, and the third is
              to examine network dynamics. The fourth aim is to explore
              relationships and sustainability over the longer term. Two
              government-funded and steered partnerships, which were
              established to increase coordination between primary care
              services in Victoria, Australia, were examined. Annual interviews
              at three points in time between 2002 and 2005 were used to
              explore relationships between organizations within these two
              partnerships. The structure of two different communication
              networks, based on contacts for work and contacts for strategic
              information, were examined using social network analysis. Tracing
              network structures over time highlighted partnership dynamics.
              The network structures changed over the three years of the study,
              but an important constant was the continuing centrality of the
              independent staff employed to manage the partnerships. Over the
              longer term, it seems to be more important to fund independent
              partnership staff, rather than people who connect partnerships to
              the funding agency. If partnerships are seen as valuable in
              improving service coordination and health outcomes, then long

              services 'closer to home', is a well-established trend. This
              study sought to provide insight into the consequences of this
              trend, in particular the stimulation of demand, by exploring the
              underlying feedback structure. METHODS: We constructed a
              simulation model using the system dynamics method, which is
              specifically designed for the analysis of feedback structure. The
              model was calibrated to two cases of the shift in cardiac
              catheterization services in the UK. Data sources included
              archival data, observations and interviews with senior health
              care professionals. Key model outputs were the basic trends
              displayed by waiting lists, average waiting times, cumulative
              patient referrals, cumulative patient activity and cumulative
              overall costs. RESULTS: Demand was stimulated in both cases via
              several different mechanisms. We revealed the roles for clinical
              guidelines and capacity changes, and the typical responses to
              imbalances between supply and demand. Our analysis also
              demonstrated the potential benefits of changing the goals that
              drive activity by seeking a waiting list goal rather than a
              waiting time goal. CONCLUSIONS: Appreciating the wider
              consequences of shifting the balance of care is essential if
              services are to be improved overall. The underlying feedback
              mechanisms of both intended and unintended effects need to be
              understood. Using a systemic approach, more effective policies
              may be designed through coordinated programmes rather than
              isolated initiatives, which may have only a limited impact.",

              important to organizations managing and providing primary care
              services given ongoing changes in health care delivery and
              payment systems. The objective of this study is to show how
              systems science methodologies could be incorporated into
              population health management to compare different interventions
              and improve health outcomes. METHODS: The New York Academy of
              Medicine Cardiovascular Health Simulation model (an agent-based
              model) and data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
              System were used to evaluate a lifestyle program that could be
              implemented in primary care practice settings. The program
              targeted Medicare-age adults and focused on improving diet and
              exercise and reducing weight. RESULTS: The simulation results
              suggest that there would be significant reductions projected in
              the proportion of the Medicare-age population with diabetes after
              the implementation of the proposed lifestyle program for a
              relatively long term (3 and 5 years). Similar results were found
              for the subpopulations with high cholesterol, but the proposed
              intervention would not have a significant effect in the
              proportion of the population with hypertension over a time period
              of <5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Systems science methodologies can be
              useful to compare the health outcomes of different interventions.
              These tools can become an important component of population
              health management because they can help managers and other
              decision makers evaluate alternative programs in primary care

              decision-making (EBDM) to address population health challenges.
              METHODS: We used the New York Academy of Medicine Cardiovascular
              Health Simulation Model to evaluate the results of a hypothetical
              program that would reduce the proportion of people smoking,
              eating fewer than 5 fruits and vegetables per day, being
              physically active less than 150 minutes per week, and who had a
              body mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m(2) or greater. We used survey
              data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to
              evaluate health outcomes and validate simulation results.
              RESULTS: Smoking rates and the proportion of the population with
              a BMI of 25 kg/m(2) or greater would have decreased significantly
              with implementation of the hypothetical program (P < .001). Two
              areas would have experienced a statistically significant
              reduction in the local population with diabetes between 2007 and
              2027 (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The use of systems science

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Public health officials and policy makers in the
              United States expend significant resources at the national,
              state, county, and city levels to measure the rate of influenza
              infection. These individuals rely on influenza infection rate
              information to make important decisions during the course of an
              influenza season driving vaccination campaigns, clinical
              guidelines, and medical staffing. Web and social media data
              sources have emerged as attractive alternatives to supplement
              existing practices. While traditional surveillance methods take
              1-2 weeks, and significant labor, to produce an infection
              estimate in each locale, web and social media data are available
              in near real-time for a broad range of locations. OBJECTIVE: The
              objective of this study was to analyze the efficacy of flu
              surveillance from combining data from the websites Google Flu
              Trends and HealthTweets at the local level. We considered both
              emergency department influenza-like illness cases and
              laboratory-confirmed influenza cases for a single hospital in the
              City of Baltimore. METHODS: This was a retrospective
              observational study comparing estimates of influenza activity of
              Google Flu Trends and Twitter to actual counts of individuals
              with laboratory-confirmed influenza, and counts of individuals
              presenting to the emergency department with influenza-like
              illness cases. Data were collected from November 20, 2011 through
              March 16, 2014. Each parameter was evaluated on the municipal,
              regional, and national scale. We examined the utility of social
              media data for tracking actual influenza infection at the
              municipal, state, and national levels. Specifically, we compared
              the efficacy of Twitter and Google Flu Trends data. RESULTS: We
              found that municipal-level Twitter data was more effective than
              regional and national data when tracking actual influenza
              infection rates in a Baltimore inner-city hospital. When
              combined, national-level Twitter and Google Flu Trends data
              outperformed each data source individually. In addition,
              influenza-like illness data at all levels of geographic
              granularity were best predicted by national Google Flu Trends
              data. CONCLUSIONS: In order to overcome sensitivity to transient
              events, such as the news cycle, the best-fitting Google Flu
              Trends model relies on a 4-week moving average, suggesting that
              it may also be sacrificing sensitivity to transient fluctuations
              in influenza infection to achieve predictive power. Implications
              for influenza forecasting are discussed in this report.",

              multi-label corpus, covering 3 languages (Japanese, English, and
              Chinese) and annotated with 8 symptom labels (such as cold,
              fever, and flu). Then, participants classify each tweet into 1 of
              the 2 categories: those containing a patient's symptom and those

              subtask, and 2 groups (6 systems) participated in the Chinese
              subtask. In total, 2 baseline systems were constructed for each
              subtask. The performance of the participant and baseline systems
              was assessed using the exact match accuracy, F-measure based on
              precision and recall, and Hamming loss. RESULTS: The best system
              achieved exactly 0.880 match accuracy, 0.920 F-measure, and 0.019
              Hamming loss. The averages of match accuracy, F-measure, and
              Hamming loss for the Japanese subtask were 0.720, 0.820, and
              0.051; those for the English subtask were 0.770, 0.850, and
              0.037; and those for the Chinese subtask were 0.810, 0.880, and

              discussed the performance of systems participating in the

              agency theory and regarded as synonymous to an agent-principal
              interaction, there exists only a sparse understanding about the
              most effective ways of governing it. OBJECTIVE: This article
              undertakes a selective review of the growing body of research on
              the governance of the physician-patient relationship to discuss
              the current state of the knowledge in the field and suggest
              promising avenues for further exploration. FINDINGS: On the basis
              of an extensive analysis of the relevant literature, we identify
              two emerging streams of inquiry on the trust-based (i.e. trust
              and ethical oversight) and distrust-based (i.e. patient

              reporting limits the potential of this form of synthesis. In this
              article, we propose recommendations to further advance the field
              of scoping review methodology. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We
              summarize current understanding of scoping review publication
              rates, terms, definitions, and methods. We propose three
              recommendations for clarity in term, definition and methodology.
              RESULTS: We recommend adopting the terms ``scoping review'' or
              ``scoping study'' and the use of a proposed definition. Until
              such time as further guidance is developed, we recommend the use

              possible to share multiple views and tacit knowledge from

              simulation modellers with a group of stakeholders to arrive at a
              common conceptual model. The framework incorporates two
              facilitated workshops. It consists of a package including: three
              key stages and sub-stages; activities and guidance; tools and
              prescribed outputs. The CM framework is tested in a real case

              making better decisions. From a policy perspective, the value of
              a model-based analysis lies not simply in its ability to generate
              a precise point estimate for a specific outcome but also in the
              systematic examination and responsible reporting of uncertainty
              surrounding this outcome and the ultimate decision being
              addressed. Different concepts relating to uncertainty in decision
              modeling are explored. Stochastic (first-order) uncertainty is
              distinguished from both parameter (second-order) uncertainty and
              from heterogeneity, with structural uncertainty relating to the
              model itself forming another level of uncertainty to consider.
              The article argues that the estimation of point estimates and
              uncertainty in parameters is part of a single process and
              explores the link between parameter uncertainty through to
              decision uncertainty and the relationship to value-of-information

              the reporting of uncertainty, both in terms of deterministic
              sensitivity analysis techniques and probabilistic methods.

              general practice/family doctor (GPFD) clinics is an accurate

              currently experiencing the influenza A (H1N1-2009) pandemic or
              preparing for subsequent epidemic waves. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL
              FINDINGS: We established a network of GPFDs in Singapore.
              Participating GPFDs submitted returns via facsimile or e-mail on
              their work days using a simple, standard data collection format,
              capturing: gender; year of birth; ``ethnicity''; residential
              status; body temperature (degrees C); and treatment (antiviral or
              not); for all cases with a clinical diagnosis of an acute
              respiratory illness (ARI). The operational definition of ILI in
              this study was an ARI with fever of 37.8 degrees C or more. The
              data were processed daily by the study co-ordinator and fed into
              a stochastic model of disease dynamics, which was refitted daily
              using particle filtering, with data and forecasts uploaded to a
              website which could be publicly accessed. Twenty-three GPFD
              clinics agreed to participate. Data collection started on
              2009-06-26 and lasted for the duration of the epidemic. The
              epidemic appeared to have peaked around 2009-08-03 and the ILI
              rates had returned to baseline levels by the time of writing.
              CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This real-time surveillance system is
              able to show the progress of an epidemic and indicates when the
              peak is reached. The resulting information can be used to form
              forecasts, including how soon the epidemic wave will end and when

               the field of socioeconomic inequalities in health. METHODS: An
               electronic search of studies assessing socioeconomic
               inequalities in health using a simulation model was conducted.
               Characteristics of the simulation models were extracted and
               distinct simulation approaches were identified. As an
               illustration, a simple agent-based model of the emergence of
               socioeconomic differences in alcohol abuse was developed.
               RESULTS: We found 61 studies published between 1989 and 2013.
               Ten different simulation approaches were identified. The

               for studying health inequalities, and refer to good modeling
               practices for developing such models. The review and the
               simulation model example suggest that the use of simulation

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The threat of a global pandemic posed by outbreaks of
              influenza H5N1 (1997) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
              (SARS, 2002), both diseases of zoonotic origin, provoked interest
              in improving early warning systems and reinforced the need for
              combining data from different sources. It led to the use of
              search query data from search engines such as Google and Yahoo!
              as an indicator of when and where influenza was occurring. This
              methodology has subsequently been extended to other diseases and
              has led to experimentation with new types of social media for
              disease surveillance. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this scoping
              review was to formally assess the current state of knowledge
              regarding the use of search queries and social media for disease
              surveillance in order to inform future work on early detection
              and more effective mitigation of the effects of foodborne
              illness. METHODS: Structured scoping review methods were used to
              identify, characterize, and evaluate all published primary
              research, expert review, and commentary articles regarding the
              use of social media in surveillance of infectious diseases from
              2002-2011. RESULTS: Thirty-two primary research articles and 19
              reviews and case studies were identified as relevant. Most
              relevant citations were peer-reviewed journal articles (29/32,
              91\%) published in 2010-11 (28/32, 88\%) and reported use of a
              Google program for surveillance of influenza. Only four primary
              research articles investigated social media in the context of
              foodborne disease or gastroenteritis. Most authors (21/32
              articles, 66\%) reported that social media-based surveillance had
              comparable performance when compared to an existing surveillance
              program. The most commonly reported strengths of social media
              surveillance programs included their effectiveness (21/32, 66\%)
              and rapid detection of disease (21/32, 66\%). The most commonly
              reported weaknesses were the potential for false positive (16/32,
              50\%) and false negative (11/32, 34\%) results. Most authors
              (24/32, 75\%) recommended that social media programs should
              primarily be used to support existing surveillance programs.
              CONCLUSIONS: The use of search queries and social media for
              disease surveillance are relatively recent phenomena (first
              reported in 2006). Both the tools themselves and the
              methodologies for exploiting them are evolving over time. While
              their accuracy, speed, and cost compare favorably with existing
              surveillance systems, the primary challenge is to refine the data
              signal by reducing surrounding noise. Further developments in
              digital disease surveillance have the potential to improve
              sensitivity and specificity, passively through advances in
              machine learning and actively through engagement of users.
              Adoption, even as supporting systems for existing surveillance,
              will entail a high level of familiarity with the tools and
              collaboration across jurisdictions.",

              is focused on the collection of data from sentinel physicians and
              hospitals; however, the compilation and distribution of reports
              are usually delayed by up to 2 weeks. With the popularity of
              social media growing, the Internet is a source for syndromic
              surveillance due to the availability of large amounts of data. In
              this study, tweets, or posts of 140 characters or less, from the
              website Twitter were collected and analyzed for their potential
              as surveillance for seasonal influenza. OBJECTIVE: There were
              three aims: (1) to improve the correlation of tweets to
              sentinel-provided influenza-like illness (ILI) rates by city
              through filtering and a machine-learning classifier, (2) to
              observe correlations of tweets for emergency department ILI rates
              by city, and (3) to explore correlations for tweets to
              laboratory-confirmed influenza cases in San Diego. METHODS:
              Tweets containing the keyword ``flu'' were collected within a
              17-mile radius from 11 US cities selected for population and
              availability of ILI data. At the end of the collection period,
              159,802 tweets were used for correlation analyses with
              sentinel-provided ILI and emergency department ILI rates as
              reported by the corresponding city or county health department.
              Two separate methods were used to observe correlations between
              tweets and ILI rates: filtering the tweets by type (non-retweets,
              retweets, tweets with a URL, tweets without a URL), and the use
              of a machine-learning classifier that determined whether a tweet
              was ``valid'', or from a user who was likely ill with the flu.
              RESULTS: Correlations varied by city but general trends were
              observed. Non-retweets and tweets without a URL had higher and
              more significant (P<.05) correlations than retweets and tweets
              with a URL. Correlations of tweets to emergency department ILI
              rates were higher than the correlations observed for
              sentinel-provided ILI for most of the cities. The
              machine-learning classifier yielded the highest correlations for
              many of the cities when using the sentinel-provided or emergency
              department ILI as well as the number of laboratory-confirmed
              influenza cases in San Diego. High correlation values (r=.93)
              with significance at P<.001 were observed for
              laboratory-confirmed influenza cases for most categories and
              tweets determined to be valid by the classifier. CONCLUSIONS:
              Compared to tweet analyses in the previous influenza season, this
              study demonstrated increased accuracy in using Twitter as a
              supplementary surveillance tool for influenza as better filtering
              and classification methods yielded higher correlations for the
              2013-2014 influenza season than those found for tweets in the
              previous influenza season, where emergency department ILI rates
              were better correlated to tweets than sentinel-provided ILI
              rates. Further investigations in the field would require
              expansion with regard to the location that the tweets are
              collected from, as well as the availability of more ILI data.",

              epidemics by detecting diseases from text messages posted on SNS
              platforms. Such applications share the following logic: they
              incorporate SNS users as social sensors. These social
              sensor-based approaches also share a common problem: SNS-based
              surveillance are much more reliable if sufficient numbers of
              users are active, and small or inactive populations produce
              inconsistent results. OBJECTIVE: This study proposes a novel
              approach to estimate the trend of patient numbers using indirect
              information covering both urban areas and rural areas within the
              posts. METHODS: We presented a TRAP model by embedding both
              direct information and indirect information. A collection of
              tweets spanning 3 years (7 million influenza-related tweets in
              Japanese) was used to evaluate the model. Both direct information
              and indirect information that mention other places were used. As
              indirect information is less reliable (too noisy or too old) than
              direct information, the indirect information data were not used
              directly and were considered as inhibiting direct information.
              For example, when indirect information appeared often, it was
              considered as signifying that everyone already had a known
              disease, leading to a small amount of direct information.
              RESULTS: The estimation performance of our approach was evaluated
              using the correlation coefficient between the number of influenza
              cases as the gold standard values and the estimated values by the
              proposed models. The results revealed that the baseline model
              (BASELINE+NLP) shows .36 and that the proposed model (TRAP+NLP)
              improved the accuracy (.70, +.34 points). CONCLUSIONS: The
              proposed approach by which the indirect information inhibits
              direct information exhibited improved estimation performance not
              only in rural cities but also in urban cities, which demonstrated
              the effectiveness of the proposed method consisting of a TRAP
              model and natural language processing (NLP) classification.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Traditional influenza surveillance relies on
              influenza-like illness (ILI) syndrome that is reported by health
              care providers. It primarily captures individuals who seek
              medical care and misses those who do not. Recently, Web-based
              data sources have been studied for application to public health
              surveillance, as there is a growing number of people who search,
              post, and tweet about their illnesses before seeking medical
              care. Existing research has shown some promise of using data from
              Google, Twitter, and Wikipedia to complement traditional
              surveillance for ILI. However, past studies have evaluated these
              Web-based sources individually or dually without comparing all 3
              of them, and it would be beneficial to know which of the
              Web-based sources performs best in order to be considered to
              complement traditional methods. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this
              study is to comparatively analyze Google, Twitter, and Wikipedia
              by examining which best corresponds with Centers for Disease
              Control and Prevention (CDC) ILI data. It was hypothesized that
              Wikipedia will best correspond with CDC ILI data as previous
              research found it to be least influenced by high media coverage
              in comparison with Google and Twitter. METHODS: Publicly
              available, deidentified data were collected from the CDC, Google
              Flu Trends, HealthTweets, and Wikipedia for the 2012-2015
              influenza seasons. Bayesian change point analysis was used to
              detect seasonal changes, or change points, in each of the data
              sources. Change points in Google, Twitter, and Wikipedia that
              occurred during the exact week, 1 preceding week, or 1 week after
              the CDC's change points were compared with the CDC data as the
              gold standard. All analyses were conducted using the R package
              ``bcp'' version 4.0.0 in RStudio version 0.99.484 (RStudio Inc).
              In addition, sensitivity and positive predictive values (PPV)
              were calculated for Google, Twitter, and Wikipedia. RESULTS:
              During the 2012-2015 influenza seasons, a high sensitivity of
              92\% was found for Google, whereas the PPV for Google was 85\%. A
              low sensitivity of 50\% was calculated for Twitter; a low PPV of
              43\% was found for Twitter also. Wikipedia had the lowest
              sensitivity of 33\% and lowest PPV of 40\%. CONCLUSIONS: Of the 3
              Web-based sources, Google had the best combination of sensitivity
              and PPV in detecting Bayesian change points in influenza-related
              data streams. Findings demonstrated that change points in Google,
              Twitter, and Wikipedia data occasionally aligned well with change
              points captured in CDC ILI data, yet these sources did not detect
              all changes in CDC data and should be further studied and
              developed.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Emergency department crowding is a major global
              healthcare issue. There is much debate as to the causes of the
              phenomenon, leading to difficulties in developing successful,
              targeted solutions. AIM: The aim of this systematic review was to
              critically analyse and summarise the findings of peer-reviewed
              research studies investigating the causes and consequences of,
              and solutions to, emergency department crowding. METHOD: The
              Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
              Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. A structured
              search of four databases (Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE and Web of
              Science) was undertaken to identify peer-reviewed research
              publications aimed at investigating the causes or consequences
              of, or solutions to, emergency department crowding, published
              between January 2000 and June 2018. Two reviewers used validated
              critical appraisal tools to independently assess the quality of
              the studies. The study protocol was registered with the
              International prospective register of systematic reviews
              (PROSPERO 2017: CRD42017073439). RESULTS: From 4,131 identified
              studies and 162 full text reviews, 102 studies met the inclusion
              criteria. The majority were retrospective cohort studies, with
              the greatest proportion (51\%) trialling or modelling potential
              solutions to emergency department crowding. Fourteen studies
              examined causes and 40 investigated consequences. Two studies
              looked at both causes and consequences, and two investigated
              causes and solutions. CONCLUSIONS: The negative consequences of
              ED crowding are well established, including poorer patient
              outcomes and the inability of staff to adhere to
              guideline-recommended treatment. This review identified a
              mismatch between causes and solutions. The majority of identified
              causes related to the number and type of people attending ED and
              timely discharge from ED, while reported solutions focused on
              efficient patient flow within the ED. Solutions aimed at the
              introduction of whole-of-system initiatives to meet timed patient
              disposition targets, as well as extended hours of primary care,
              demonstrated promising outcomes. While the review identified
              increased presentations by the elderly with complex and chronic
              conditions as an emerging and widespread driver of crowding, more
              research is required to isolate the precise local factors leading
              to ED crowding, with system-wide solutions tailored to address
              identified causes.",

  abstract = "STUDY OBJECTIVE: This study compares how throughput and output
              factors affect emergency department (ED) median waiting room
              time. METHODS: Administrative health care use records were used
              to identify all daytime (8 am to 8 pm) visits made to adult EDs
              in Winnipeg, Canada, between April 1, 2012, and March 31, 2013.
              First, we measured the waiting room time (from patient
              registration until transfer into the ED) of each index visit
              (incoming patient). We then linked each index visit to a group of
              existing patients surrounding it and counted the number of
              existing patients engaged in throughput processes (radiographs,
              computed tomography [CT] scans, advanced diagnostic tests) and
              one output process (waiting to be hospitalized). Regression
              analysis was used to measure how strongly each factor uniquely
              affected incoming patient median waiting room time, stratified by
              the acuity level. RESULTS: Analyses were performed on 143,172
              index visits. On average, 153.4 radiographs and 48.5 CT scans
              were conducted daily, whereas 45.3 patients were admitted daily
              to hospital. Median waiting room time was shortest (8.0 minutes)
              for the highest-acuity index visits and was not influenced by
              these throughput or output factors. For all other index visits,
              median waiting room time was associated strongly with the number
              of existing patients receiving radiographs, and, to a lesser
              extent, with the number of existing patients receiving CT scans
              and waiting for hospital admission. CONCLUSION: Both throughput
              and output factors affect how long newly arriving ED patients
              remain in the waiting room. This suggests that a range of
              strategies may help to reduce ED wait time, each requiring
              stronger ED and hospital partnerships.",

              (individual based models, IBM) or agents (agent-based models,

              also in many other disciplines dealing with complex systems made

              proposed standard protocol, ODD, for describing IBMs and ABMs,
              developed and tested by 28 modellers who cover a wide range of
              fields within ecology. This protocol consists of three blocks
              (Overview, Design concepts, and Details), which are subdivided

              overview and scheduling, Design concepts, Initialization, Input,
              and Submodels. We explain which aspects of a model should be
              described in each element, and we present an example to
              illustrate the protocol in use. In addition, 19 examples are

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: There is an increasing recognition that modelling and
              simulation can assist in the process of designing health care
              policies, strategies and operations. However, the current use is
              limited and answers to questions such as what methods to use and
              when remain somewhat underdeveloped. AIM: The aim of this study
              is to provide a mechanism for decision makers in health services
              planning and management to compare a broad range of modelling and
              simulation methods so that they can better select and use them or
              better commission relevant modelling and simulation work.
              METHODS: This paper proposes a modelling and simulation method
              comparison and selection tool developed from a comprehensive
              literature review, the research team's extensive expertise and
              inputs from potential users. Twenty-eight different methods were
              identified, characterised by their relevance to different
              application areas, project life cycle stages, types of output and
              levels of insight, and four input resources required (time,
              money, knowledge and data). RESULTS: The characterisation is
              presented in matrix forms to allow quick comparison and
              selection. This paper also highlights significant knowledge gaps
              in the existing literature when assessing the applicability of
              particular approaches to health services management, where
              modelling and simulation skills are scarce let alone money and
              time. CONCLUSIONS: A modelling and simulation method comparison
              and selection tool is developed to assist with the selection of
              methods appropriate to supporting specific decision making
              processes. In particular it addresses the issue of which method
              is most appropriate to which specific health services management
              problem, what the user might expect to be obtained from the
              method, and what is required to use the method. In summary, we
              believe the tool adds value to the scarce existing literature on
              methods comparison and selection.",

  abstract = "Depression is the most common mental health disorder and is
              recognized as a chronic disease characterized by multiple acute
              episodes/relapses. Although modelling techniques play an
              increasingly important role in the economic evaluation of
              depression interventions, comparatively little attention has been
              paid to issues around modelling studies with a focus on potential
              biases. This, however, is important as different modelling
              approaches, variations in model structure and input parameters
              may produce different results, and hence different policy
              decisions. This paper presents a critical review of literature on
              recently published model-based cost-utility studies of
              depression. Taking depression as an illustrative example, through
              this review, we discuss a number of specific issues in relation
              to the use of decision-analytic models including the type of
              modelling techniques, structure of models and data sources. The
              potential benefits and limitations of each modelling technique
              are discussed and factors influencing the choice of modelling
              techniques are addressed. This review found that model-based
              studies of depression used various simulation techniques. We note
              that a discrete-event simulation may be the preferred technique
              for the economic evaluation of depression due to the greater
              flexibility with respect to handling time compared with other
              individual-based modelling techniques. Considering prognosis and
              management of depression, the structure of the reviewed models
              are discussed. We argue that a few reviewed models did not
              include some important structural aspects such as the possibility
              of relapse or the increased risk of suicide in patients with
              depression. Finally, the appropriateness of data sources used to
              estimate input parameters with a focus on transition
              probabilities is addressed. We argue that the above issues can
              potentially bias results and reduce the comparability of economic
              evaluations.",

              examples of health care system interventions in which such
              methods could be useful. Three dynamic simulation modeling

               evaluation of public health strategies aimed at controlling or
               eradicating particular infections. Such a framework is
               increasingly important in light of the widespread concern for

               malaria, river blindness, sleeping sickness, and
               schistosomiasis, and the advent of AIDS/HIV and other emerging

               for thinking clearly about fundamental and applied problems
               having to do with infectious diseases. The book is divided into

  author   = "Schanzer, Dena L and Schwartz, Brian",
  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Weekly influenza-like illness (ILI) consultation
              rates are an integral part of influenza surveillance. However, in
              most health care settings, only a small proportion of true
              influenza cases are clinically diagnosed as influenza or ILI. The
              primary objective of this study was to estimate the number and
              rate of visits to the emergency department (ED) that are
              attributable to seasonal and pandemic influenza and to describe
              the effect of influenza on the ED by age, diagnostic categories,
              and visit disposition. A secondary objective was to assess the
              weekly ``real-time'' time series of ILI ED visits as an indicator
              of the full burden due to influenza. METHODS: The authors
              performed an ecologic analysis of ED records extracted from the
              National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (NARCS) database for
              the province of Ontario, Canada, from September 2003 to March
              2010 and stratified by diagnostic characteristics (International
              Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision [ICD-10]), age, and
              visit disposition. A regression model was used to estimate the
              seasonal baseline. The weekly number of influenza-attributable ED
              visits was calculated as the difference between the weekly number
              of visits predicted by the statistical model and the estimated
              baseline. RESULTS: The estimated rate of ED visits attributable
              to influenza was elevated during the H1N1/2009 pandemic period at
              1,000 per 100,000 (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 920 to 1,100)
              population compared to an average annual rate of 500 per 100,000
              (95\% CI = 450 to 550) for seasonal influenza. ILI or influenza
              was clinically diagnosed in one of 2.6 (38\%) and one of 14 (7\%)
              of these visits, respectively. While the ILI or clinical
              influenza diagnosis was the diagnosis most specific to influenza,
              only 87\% and 58\% of the clinically diagnosed ILI or influenza
              visits for pandemic and seasonal influenza, respectively, were
              likely directly due to an influenza infection. Rates for ILI ED
              visits were highest for younger age groups, while the likelihood
              of admission to hospital was highest in older persons. During
              periods of seasonal influenza activity, there was a significant
              increase in the number of persons who registered with
              nonrespiratory complaints, but left without being seen. This
              effect was more pronounced during the 2009 pandemic. The ratio of
              influenza-attributed respiratory visits to influenza-attributed
              ILI visits varied from 2.4:1 for the fall H1N1/2009 wave to 9:1
              for the 2003/04 influenza A(H3N2) season and 28:1 for the 2007/08
              H1N1 season. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza appears to have had a much
              larger effect on ED visits than was captured by clinical
              diagnoses of influenza or ILI. Throughout the study period, ILI
              ED visits were strongly associated with excess respiratory
              complaints. However, the relationship between ILI ED visits and
              the estimated effect of influenza on ED visits was not consistent
              enough from year to year to predict the effect of influenza on
              the ED or downstream in-hospital resource requirements.",

              affect patient satisfaction and quality of care. We develop and
              validate a model that predicts an individual patient's median and
              95th percentile waiting time by using only data available at
              triage. METHODS: From the existing ED information system, we
              extracted date and time of triage completion, start time of
              emergency physician consultation, and patient acuity category
              (1=most urgent, 3=least urgent). Quantile regression was applied
              for model development and parameter estimation by using visits
              from January 2011. We assessed absolute prediction error, defined
              as the median difference between the 50th percentile (median)
              predicted waiting time and actual waiting time, and the
              proportion of underestimated prediction, defined as the
              percentage of patients whose actual waiting time exceeded the
              95th percentile prediction. The model was validated
              retrospectively with June 2010 data and prospectively with data
              from April to June 2011 after integration with the existing ED
              information system. RESULTS: The derivation set included 13,200
              ED visits; 903 (6.8\%) were patient acuity category 1, 5,530
              (41.9\%) were patient acuity category 2, and 6,767 (51.3\%) were
              patient acuity category 3. The median and 95th percentile waiting
              times were 17 and 57 minutes for patient acuity category 2 and 21
              and 89 minutes for patient acuity category 3, respectively. The
              final model used predictors of patient acuity category, patient
              queue sizes, and flow rates only. In the retrospective
              validation, 5.9\% of patient acuity category 2 and 5.4\% of
              category 3 waiting times were underestimated. The median absolute
              prediction error was 11.9 minutes (interquantile range [IQR] 5.9
              to 22.1 minutes) for patient acuity category 2 and 15.7 minutes
              (IQR 7.5 to 30.1 minutes) for category 3. In prospective
              validation, 4.3\% of patient acuity category 2 and 5.8\% of
              category 3 waiting times were underestimated. The median absolute
              prediction error was 9.2 minutes (IQR 4.4 to 15.1 minutes) for
              patient acuity category 2 and 12.9 minutes (IQR 6.5 to 22.5
              minutes) for category 3. CONCLUSION: Using only a few data

              activity in the Boston metropolis separately. We then adapted a
              multivariate dynamic regression method named ARGO (autoregression
              with general online information), designed for tracking influenza
              at the national level, and showed that it effectively uses the
              above data sources to monitor and forecast influenza at the city
              level 1 week ahead of the current date. Finally, we presented an
              ensemble-based approach capable of combining information from
              models based on multiple data sources to more robustly nowcast as
              well as forecast influenza activity in the Boston metropolitan
              area. The performances of our models were evaluated in an
              out-of-sample fashion over 4 influenza seasons within 2012-2016,
              as well as a holdout validation period from 2016 to 2017.
              RESULTS: Our ensemble-based methods incorporating information
              from diverse models based on multiple data sources, including
              ARGO, produced the most robust and accurate results. The observed
              Pearson correlations between our out-of-sample flu activity
              estimates and those historically reported by the BPHC were 0.98
              in nowcasting influenza and 0.94 in forecasting influenza 1 week
              ahead of the current date. CONCLUSIONS: We show that information
              from Internet-based data sources, when combined using an
              informed, robust methodology, can be effectively used as early
              indicators of influenza activity at fine geographic resolutions.",

              providing real-time (``nowcast'') and forecast estimates of
              influenza activity in the US by leveraging data from multiple
              data sources including: Google searches, Twitter microblogs,
              nearly real-time hospital visit records, and data from a
              participatory surveillance system. Our main contribution consists
              of combining multiple influenza-like illnesses (ILI) activity
              estimates, generated independently with each data source, into a
              single prediction of ILI utilizing machine learning ensemble
              approaches. Our methodology exploits the information in each data
              source and produces accurate weekly ILI predictions for up to
              four weeks ahead of the release of CDC's ILI reports. We evaluate
              the predictive ability of our ensemble approach during the
              2013-2014 (retrospective) and 2014-2015 (live) flu seasons for
              each of the four weekly time horizons. Our ensemble approach
              demonstrates several advantages: (1) our ensemble method's
              predictions outperform every prediction using each data source
              independently, (2) our methodology can produce predictions one
              week ahead of GFT's real-time estimates with comparable accuracy,
              and (3) our two and three week forecast estimates have comparable
              accuracy to real-time predictions using an autoregressive model.
              Moreover, our results show that considerable insight is gained
              from incorporating disparate data streams, in the form of social

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Emergency department (ED) visits increase during
              the influenza seasons. It is essential to identify statistically
              significant correlates in order to develop an accurate
              forecasting model for ED visits. Forecasting
              influenza-like-illness (ILI)-related ED visits can significantly
              help in developing robust resource management strategies at the
              EDs. METHODS: We first performed correlation analyses to
              understand temporal correlations between several predictors of
              ILI-related ED visits. We used the data available for Douglas
              County, the biggest county in Nebraska, for Omaha, the biggest
              city in the state, and for a major hospital in Omaha. The data
              set included total and positive influenza test results from the
              hospital (ie, Antigen rapid (Ag) and Respiratory Syncytial Virus
              Infection (RSV) tests); an Internet-based influenza surveillance
              system data, that is, Google Flu Trends, for both Nebraska and
              Omaha; total ED visits in Douglas County attributable to ILI; and
              ILI surveillance network data for Douglas County and Nebraska as
              the predictors and data for the hospital's ILI-related ED visits
              as the dependent variable. We used Seasonal Autoregressive
              Integrated Moving Average and Holt Winters methods with3 linear
              regression models to forecast ILI-related ED visits at the
              hospital and evaluated model performances by comparing the root
              means square errors (RMSEs). RESULTS: Because of strong positive
              correlations with ILI-related ED visits between 2008 and 2012, we
              validated the use of Google Flu Trends data as a predictor in an
              ED influenza surveillance tool. Of the 5 forecasting models we
              have tested, linear regression models performed significantly
              better when Google Flu Trends data were included as a predictor.
              Regression models including Google Flu Trends data as a predictor
              variable have lower RMSE, and the lowest is achieved when all
              other variables are also included in the model in our forecasting
              experiments for the first 5 weeks of 2013 (with RMSE = 57.61).
              CONCLUSIONS: Google Flu Trends data statistically improve the
              performance of predicting ILI-related ED visits in Douglas
              County, and this result can be generalized to other communities.
              Timely and accurate estimates of ED volume during the influenza
              season, as well as during pandemic outbreaks, can help hospitals
              plan their ED resources accordingly and lower their costs by
              optimizing supplies and staffing and can improve service quality
              by decreasing ED wait times and overcrowding.",

               literature since 2003 to catalogue reported methods of
               stakeholder engagement in comparative effectiveness research and
               patient-centered outcomes research. METHODS AND RESULTS: We
               worked with stakeholders before, during and after the review was
               conducted to: define the primary and key research questions;
               conduct the literature search; screen titles, abstracts and
               articles; abstract data from the articles; and analyze the data.
               The literature search yielded 2,062 abstracts. The review was
               conducted on 70 articles that reported on stakeholder engagement
               in individual research projects or programs. FINDINGS: Reports
               of stakeholder engagement are highly variable in content and
               quality. We found frequent engagement with patients, modestly
               frequent engagement with clinicians, and infrequent engagement
               with stakeholders in other key decision-making groups across the
               healthcare system. Stakeholder engagement was more common in
               earlier (prioritization) than in later (implementation and
               dissemination) stages of research. The roles and activities of
               stakeholders were highly variable across research and program
               reports. RECOMMENDATIONS: To improve on the quality and content
               of reporting, we developed a 7-Item Stakeholder Engagement
               Reporting Questionnaire. We recommend three directions for
               future research: 1) descriptive research on
               stakeholder-engagement in research; 2) evaluative research on
               the impact of stakeholder engagement on the relevance,
               transparency and adoption of research; and 3) development and
               validation of tools that can be used to support stakeholder

               technology available to them than ever before. Yet recent
               reports have raised serious doubts about the quality of health
               care in America. Crossing the Quality Chasm makes an urgent call
               for fundamental change to close the quality gap. This book
               recommends a sweeping redesign of the American health care
               system and provides overarching principles for specific
               direction for policymakers, health care leaders, clinicians,
               regulators, purchasers, and others. In this comprehensive volume
               the committee offers: A set of performance expectations for the
               21st century health care system. A set of 10 new rules to guide
               patient-clinician relationships. A suggested organizing
               framework to better align the incentives inherent in payment and
               accountability with improvements in quality. Key steps to
               promote evidence-based practice and strengthen clinical
               information systems. Analyzing health care organizations as
               complex systems, Crossing the Quality Chasm also documents the
               causes of the quality gap, identifies current practices that
               impede quality care, and explores how systems approaches can be
               used to implement change.",

              representative data, we evaluated the use of interventions to
              address crowding in US hospitals in the period 2007-10. We
              examined the relationship between crowding within an ED itself,

              interventions adopted. In our study period the average number of
              interventions adopted increased from 5.2 to 6.6, and seven of the
              seventeen studied interventions saw a significant increase in
              adoption. In general, more crowded EDs adopted greater numbers of
              interventions than less crowded EDs. However, in the most crowded
              quartile of EDs, a large proportion had not adopted effective
              interventions: 19 percent did not use bedside registration, and
              94 percent did not use surgical schedule smoothing. Thus, while
              adoption of strategies to reduce ED crowding is increasing, many

               sample size of individual units (microunits), each with a unique
               set of attributes, and allows for the simulation of downstream
               events on the basis of predefined states and transition
               probabilities between those states over time. In this article,
               we describe the history of the role of microsimulation in
               medicine and its potential applications in oncology as useful
               tools for population risk stratification and treatment strategy
               design for precision medicine.MethodsWe conducted a
               comprehensive and methodical search of the literature using
               electronic databases?Medline, Embase, and Cochrane?for works
               published between 1985 and 2016. A medical subject heading
               search strategy was constructed for Medline searches by using a
               combination of relevant search terms, such as ?microsimulation
               model medicine,? ?multistate modeling cancer,? and
               ?oncology.?ResultsMicrosimulation modeling is particularly
               useful for the study of optimal intervention strategies when
               randomized control trials may not be feasible, ethical, or
               practical. Microsimulation models can retain memory of prior
               behaviors and states. As such, it allows an explicit
               representation and understanding of how various processes
               propagate over time and affect the final outcomes for an
               individual or in a population.ConclusionA well-calibrated
               microsimulation model can be used to predict the outcome of the
               event of interest for a new individual or subpopulations, assess
               the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of alternative
               interventions, and project the future disease burden of
               oncologic diseases. In the growing field of oncology research, a

  title    = "Enhancing implementation science by applying best principles of

  author   = "Northridge, Mary E and Metcalf, Sara S",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Implementation science holds promise for better
              ensuring that research is translated into evidence-based policy
              and practice, but interventions often fail or even worsen the
              problems they are intended to solve due to a lack of
              understanding of real world structures and dynamic complexity.
              While systems science alone cannot possibly solve the major
              challenges in public health, systems-based approaches may
              contribute to changing the language and methods for
              conceptualising and acting within complex systems. The
              overarching goal of this paper is to improve the modelling used
              in dissemination and implementation research by applying best
              principles of systems science. DISCUSSION: Best principles, as
              distinct from the more customary term 'best practices', are used
              to underscore the need to extract the core issues from the
              context in which they are embedded in order to better ensure that
              they are transferable across settings. Toward meaningfully
              grappling with the complex and challenging problems faced in
              adopting and integrating evidence-based health interventions and
              changing practice patterns within specific settings, we propose
              and illustrate four best principles derived from our systems
              science experience: (1) model the problem, not the system; (2)
              pay attention to what is important, not just what is
              quantifiable; (3) leverage the utility of models as boundary
              objects; and (4) adopt a portfolio approach to model building. To
              improve our mental models of the real world, system scientists
              have created methodologies such as system dynamics, agent-based
              modelling, geographic information science and social network
              simulation. To understand dynamic complexity, we need the ability
              to simulate. Otherwise, our understanding will be limited. The
              practice of dynamic systems modelling, as discussed herein, is
              the art and science of linking system structure to behaviour for
              the purpose of changing structure to improve behaviour. A useful
              computer model creates a knowledge repository and a virtual
              library for internally consistent exploration of alternative
              assumptions. CONCLUSION: Among the benefits of systems modelling
              are iterative practice, participatory potential and possibility
              thinking. We trust that the best principles proposed here will
              resonate with implementation scientists; applying them to the
              modelling process may abet the translation of research into
              effective policy and practice.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Several developed countries have initiated chlamydia
              screening programmes. Screening for a sexually transmitted
              infection has both direct individual and indirect population-wide
              effects. Mathematical models can incorporate these non-linear
              effects and estimate the likely impact of different screening
              programmes and identify areas where more data are needed.
              METHODS: A stochastic, individual based dynamic network model,
              parameterised from UK screening studies and data on sexual
              behaviour and chlamydia epidemiology, was used to investigate the
              likely impact of opportunistic screening on chlamydia prevalence.
              Three main strategies were considered for <25 year olds: (1)
              annual offer to women; (2) annual offer to women or if changed
              partner within last 6 months; (3) annual offer to men and women.
              Sensitivity analyses were performed for key screening parameters
              including uptake rate, targeted age range, percentage of partners
              notified, and screening interval. RESULTS: Under strategy 1,
              continuous opportunistic screening of women <25 years of age is
              expected to reduce the population prevalence by over 50\% after 5
              years. Prevalence is also expected to decrease in unscreened
              older women and in men. For all three strategies screening those
              aged over 25 results in small additional reductions in
              prevalence. Including men led to a faster and greater reduction
              in overall prevalence, but involved approximately twice as many
              tests as strategy 1 and 10\% more than strategy 2. The frequency
              of attendance at healthcare sites limits the number of
              opportunities to screen and the effect of changing the screening
              interval. CONCLUSIONS: The model suggests that continuous
              opportunistic screening at high uptake rates could significantly
              reduced chlamydia prevalence within a few years. Opportunistic
              programmes depend on regular attendance at healthcare providers,
              but there is a lack of high quality data on patterns of
              attendance. Inequalities in coverage may result in a less
              efficient and less equitable outcome.",

              the mechanisms of social transmission of Mycobacterium bovis
              between individuals. Here, I use a network approach to examine
              for correlations between five distinct types of intra- and
              intergroup social interaction and changes in TB status of 110
              wild meerkats (Suricata suricatta) in five social groups over two
              years. Contrary to predictions, the most socially interactive
              animals were not at highest risk of acquiring infection,
              indicating that in addition to contact frequency, the type and
              direction of interactions must be considered when quantifying
              disease risk. Within social groups, meerkats that groomed others
              most were more likely to become infected than individuals who
              received high levels of grooming. Conversely, receiving, but not
              initiating, aggression was associated with M. bovis infection.
              Incidence of intergroup roving by male meerkats was correlated
              with the rovers themselves subsequently testing TB-positive,
              suggesting a possible route for transmission of infection between
              social groups. Exposure time was less important than these social
              interactions in influencing TB risk. This study represents a

              identify high-risk individuals was also assessed. ``Centrality''
              describes an individual's position in a population; numerous
              parameters are available to assess this attribute. Here, the
              authors use the centrality measures degree (number of contacts),

  abstract = "STUDY OBJECTIVE: The extent to which patients presenting to
              emergency departments (EDs) with minor conditions contribute to
              delays and crowding is controversial. To test this question, we
              study the effect of low-complexity ED patients on the waiting
              times of other patients. METHODS: We obtained administrative
              records on all ED visits to Ontario hospitals from April 2002 to
              March 2003. For each ED, we determined the association between
              the number of new low-complexity patients (defined as ambulatory
              arrival, low-acuity triage level, and discharged) presenting in
              each 8-hour interval and the mean ED length of stay and time to
              first physician contact for medium- and high-complexity patients.
              Covariates were the number of new high- and medium-complexity
              patients, mean patient age, sex distribution, hospital teaching
              status, work shift, weekday/weekend, and total patient-hours.
              Autoregression modeling was used given correlation in the data.
              RESULTS: One thousand ninety-five consecutive 8-hour intervals at
              110 EDs were analyzed; 4.1 million patient visits occurred,
              50.8\% of patients were women, and mean age was 38.4 years. Low-,
              medium-, and high-complexity patients represented 50.9\%, 37.1\%,
              and 12\% of all patients, respectively. Mean (median) ED length
              of stay was 6.3 (4.7), 3.9 (2.8), and 2.2 (1.6) hours for high-,
              medium-, and low-complexity patients, respectively, and mean
              (median) time to first physician contact was 1.1 (0.7), 1.3
              (0.9), and 1.1 (0.8) hours. In adjusted analyses, every 10
              low-complexity patients arriving per 8 hours was associated with
              a 5.4-minute (95\% confidence interval [CI] 4.2 to 6.0 minutes)
              increase in mean length of stay and a 2.1-minute (95\% CI 1.8 to
              2.4 minutes) increase in mean time to first physician contact for
              medium- and high-complexity patients. Results were similar
              regardless of ED volume and teaching status. CONCLUSION:
              Low-complexity ED patients are associated with a negligible
              increase in ED length of stay and time to first physician contact
              for other ED patients. Reducing the number of low-complexity ED
              patients is unlikely to reduce waiting times for other patients
              or lessen crowding.",

              Investigating the role of central individuals within a network
              may help predict infectious agent transmission as well as
              implement disease control strategies, but little is known about
              such dynamics in real primate networks. We combined social
              network analysis and a modeling approach to better understand
              transmission of a theoretical infectious agent in wild Japanese
              macaques, highly social animals which form extended but highly
              differentiated social networks. We collected focal data from
              adult females living on the islands of Koshima and Yakushima,
              Japan. Individual identities as well as grooming networks were
              included in a Markov graph-based simulation. In this model, the
              probability that an individual will transmit an infectious agent
              depends on the strength of its relationships with other group
              members. Similarly, its probability of being infected depends on
              its relationships with already infected group members. We
              correlated: (i) the percentage of subjects infected during a
              latency-constrained epidemic; (ii) the mean latency to complete
              transmission; (iii) the probability that an individual is
              infected first among all group members; and (iv) each
              individual's mean rank in the chain of transmission with
              different individual network centralities (eigenvector, strength,
              betweenness). Our results support the hypothesis that more
              central individuals transmit infections in a shorter amount of
              time and to more subjects but also become infected more quickly
              than less central individuals. However, we also observed that the
              spread of infectious agents on the Yakushima network did not
              always differ from expectations of spread on random networks.
              Generalizations about the importance of observed social networks
              in pathogen flow should thus be made with caution, since
              individual characteristics in some real world networks appear
              less relevant than they are in others in predicting disease
              spread. Am. J. Primatol. 78:767-779, 2016. \copyright{} 2016

              targeting postlanding screening for and treatment of latent
              tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in people migrating to Canada who
              are at increased risk for TB reactivation. Our objectives were to
              calculate robust longitudinal estimates of TB incidence in a
              cohort of people migrating to British Columbia, Canada, over a
              29-year period, and to identify groups at highest risk of
              developing TB based on demographic characteristics at time of
              landing. METHODS: We included all individuals (n = 1 080 908) who
              became permanent residents of Canada between Jan. 1, 1985, and
              Dec. 31, 2012, and were resident in BC at any time between 1985
              and 2013. Multiple administrative databases were linked to the
              provincial TB registry. We used recursive partitioning models to
              identify populations with high TB yield. RESULTS: Active TB was
              diagnosed in 2814 individuals (incidence rate 24.2/100 000
              person-years). Demographic factors (live-in caregiver, family,
              refugee immigration classes; higher TB incidence in country of
              birth; and older age) were strong predictors of TB incidence in
              BC, with elevated rates continuing many years after entry into
              the cohort. Recursive partitioning identified refugees 18-64
              years of age from countries with a TB incidence greater than
              224/100 000 population as a high-yield group, with 1\% developing
              TB within the first 10 years. INTERPRETATION: These findings
              support recommendations in Canadian guidelines to target
              postlanding screening for and treatment of LTBI in adult refugees
              from high-incidence countries. Because high-yield populations can
              be identified at entry via demographic data, screening at this
              point may be practical and high-impact, particularly if the LTBI
              care cascade can be optimized.",

              type 2 diabetes mellitus ({ECHO-T2DM})",
  author   = "Willis, Michael and Asseburg, Christian and He, Jianming",
  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: This study constructed the Economic and Health
              Outcomes Model for type 2 diabetes mellitus (ECHO-T2DM), a
              long-term stochastic microsimulation model, to predict the costs
              and health outcomes in patients with T2DM. Naturally, the
              usefulness of the model depends upon its predictive accuracy. The
              objective of this work is to present results of a formal
              validation exercise of ECHO-T2DM. METHODS: The validity of
              ECHO-T2DM was assessed using criteria recommended by the
              International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes
              Research/Society for Medical Decision Making (ISPOR/SMDM).
              Specifically, the results of a number of clinical trials were
              predicted and compared with observed study end-points using a
              scatterplot and regression approach. An F-test of the
              best-fitting regression was added to assess whether it differs
              statistically from the identity (45°) line defining perfect
              predictions. In addition to testing the full model using all of
              the validation study data, tests were also performed of
              microvascular, macrovascular, and survival outcomes separately.
              The validation tests were also performed separately by type of
              data (used vs not used to construct the model, economic
              simulations, and treatment effects). RESULTS: The intercept and
              slope coefficients of the best-fitting regression line between
              the predicted outcomes and corresponding trial end-points in the
              main analysis were -0.0011 and 1.067, respectively, and the R(2)
              was 0.95. A formal F-test of no difference between the fitted
              line and the identity line could not be rejected (p = 0.16). The
              high R(2) confirms that the data points are closely (and
              linearly) associated with the fitted regression line. Additional
              analyses identified that disagreement was highest for
              macrovascular end-points, for which the intercept and slope
              coefficients were 0.0095 and 1.225, respectively. The R(2) was
              0.95 and the estimated intercept and slope coefficients were
              0.017 and 1.048, respectively, for mortality, and the F-test was
              narrowly rejected (p = 0.04). The sub-set of microvascular
              end-points showed some tendency to over-predict (the slope
              coefficient was 1.095), although concordance between predictions
              and observed values could not be rejected (p = 0.16).
              LIMITATIONS: Important study limitations include: (1) data
              availability limited one to tests based on end-of-study outcomes
              rather than time-varying outcomes during the studies analyzed;
              (2) complex inclusion and exclusion criteria in two studies were
              difficult to replicate; (3) some of the studies were older and
              reflect outdated treatment patterns; and (4) the authors were
              unable to identify published data on resource use and costs of
              T2DM suitable for testing the validity of the economic
              calculations. CONCLUSIONS: Using conventional methods, ECHO-T2DM
              simulated the treatment, progression, and patient outcomes
              observed in important clinical trials with an accuracy consistent
              with other well-accepted models. Macrovascular outcomes were
              over-predicted, which is common in health-economic models of
              diabetes (and may be related to a general over-prediction of
              event rates in the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study
              [UKPDS] Outcomes Model). Work is underway in ECHO-T2DM to
              incorporate new risk equations to improve model prediction.",

              were constructed with length of stay (LOS), wait time, treatment
              time, and boarding time as dependent variables. The products of

              variables and their regression coefficients demonstrate the
              actual impact (in minutes) of each of these factors on throughput
              outcomes. RESULTS: An increase from the 20th to the 80th
              percentile in ED arrivals resulted in increases of 42 minutes in
              wait time, 49 minutes in LOS (admitted patients), and 24 minutes
              in ED boarding time (admitted patients). For admit percentage

  abstract = "The Canadian Partnership Against Cancer was created in 2007 by
              the federal government to accelerate cancer control across
              Canada. Its OncoSim microsimulation model platform, which
              consists of a suite of specific cancer models, was conceived as a
              tool to augment conventional resources for population-level
              policy- and decision-making. The Canadian Partnership Against
              Cancer manages the OncoSim program, with funding from Health
              Canada and model development by Statistics Canada.
              Microsimulation modelling allows for the detailed capture of
              population heterogeneity and health and demographic history over
              time. Extensive data from multiple Canadian sources were used as
              inputs or to validate the model. OncoSim has been validated
              through expert consultation; assessments of face validity,
              internal validity, and external validity; and model fit against
              observed data. The platform comprises three in-depth cancer
              models (lung, colorectal, cervical), with another in-depth model
              (breast) and a generalized model (25 cancers) being in
              development. Unique among models of its class, OncoSim is
              available online for public sector use free of charge. Users can
              customize input values and output display, and extensive user
              support is provided. OncoSim has been used to support
              decision-making at the national and jurisdictional levels.
              Although simulation studies are generally not included in
              hierarchies of evidence, they are integral to informing cancer
              control policy when clinical studies are not feasible. OncoSim
              can evaluate complex intervention scenarios for multiple cancers.
              Canadian decision-makers thus have a powerful tool to assess the
              costs, benefits, cost-effectiveness, and budgetary effects of
              cancer control interventions when faced with difficult choices
              for improvements in population health and resource allocation.",

              reporting economic evaluations and the editors and peer reviewers
              assessing them for publication. The need for new reporting
              guidance was identified by a survey of medical editors. A list of
              possible items based on a systematic review was created. A two
              round, modified Delphi panel consisting of representatives from
              academia, clinical practice, industry, government, and the
              editorial community was conducted. Out of 44 candidate items, 24
              items and accompanying recommendations were developed. The

              with and without comorbid mental illness or addiction differ in
              terms of their sociodemographic and health characteristics.
              Unique characteristics would warrant different considerations for
              interventions and service design aimed at reducing unnecessary
              health care utilization and associated costs. METHODS: From the
              top 10\% of Ontarians ranked by total medical care costs during
              fiscal year 2011/2012 (N = 314,936), prior 2-year mental illness
              or addiction diagnoses were determined from administrative data.
              Sociodemographics, medical illness characteristics, medical
              costs, and utilization were compared between those high-cost
              users of medical care with and without comorbid mental illness or
              addiction. Odds of being a frequent user of inpatient ($\geq$3
              admissions) and emergency ($\geq$5 visits) services were compared
              between groups, adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status and
              medical illness characteristics. RESULTS: High-cost users of
              medical care with comorbid mental illness or addiction were
              younger, had a lower socioeconomic status, had greater historical
              medical morbidity, and had higher total medical care costs (mean
              excess of \$2,031/user) than those without. They were more likely
              to be frequent users of inpatient (12.8\% vs 10.2\%; adjusted OR,
              1.14; 95\% CI: 1.12-1.17) and emergency (8.4\% vs 4.8\%; adjusted

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Although many Canadian studies have provided
              disease-specific or patient group-specific utility scores, the
              utility score norms currently available for the general Canadian
              population are outdated. Canadian guideline recommendations for
              the economic evaluation of health technologies advocate for
              utilities reflecting those of the general population and for
              stratified analyses when results are heterogeneous; as such,
              there is also a need for age-, sex- and jurisdiction-specific
              utility score norms. METHODS: We used data from the 2013-2014
              Canadian Community Health Survey. We used the Health Utilities
              Index Mark 3 to calculate utility scores. We estimated means
              (with 95\% confidence intervals [CIs]) and medians (with
              interquartile ranges [IQRs]) for utility scores. In addition to
              Canadian-level measures, we stratified all utility score norms by
              respondents' age, sex, and province or territory of residence. We
              weighted respondents' answers and computed 95\% CIs using
              sampling weights and bootstrap weights provided by Statistics
              Canada to extrapolate the study findings to the Canadian
              population. RESULTS: Respondents to the 2013-2014 Canadian
              Community Health Survey represented 30 014 589 community-dwelling
              Canadians 12 years of age and older (98\% of the Canadian
              population); half of the respondents were female (50.6\%), and
              the weighted average age was 44.8 (95\% CI 44.7-44.9) years. The
              mean and median self-reported utility scores for Canadians were
              estimated at 0.863 (95\% CI 0.861-0.865) and 0.927 (IQR
              0.838-0.972), respectively. INTERPRETATION: This study provides
              utility score norms for several age-, sex-and
              jurisdiction-specific strata in Canada. These results will be
              useful for future cost-utility analyses and could serve as

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The IMS CORE Diabetes Model (CDM) is a widely
              published and validated simulation model applied in both type 1
              diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
              analyses. Validation to external studies is an important part of
              demonstrating model credibility. OBJECTIVE: Because the CDM is
              widely used to estimate long-term clinical outcomes in diabetes
              patients, the objective of this analysis was to validate the CDM
              to contemporary outcomes studies, including those with long-term
              follow-up periods. METHODS: A total of 112 validation simulations
              were performed, stratified by study follow-up duration. For
              long-term results ($\geq$15-year follow-up), simulation cohorts
              representing baseline Diabetes Control and Complications Trial
              (DCCT) and United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS)
              cohorts were generated and intensive and conventional treatment
              arms were defined in the CDM. Predicted versus observed
              macrovascular and microvascular complications and all-cause
              mortality were assessed using the coefficient of determination
              (R(2)) goodness-of-fit measure. RESULTS: Across all validation
              studies, the CDM simulations produced an R(2) statistic of 0.90.
              For validation studies with a follow-up duration of less than 15
              years, R(2) values of 0.90 and 0.88 were achieved for T1DM and
              T2DM respectively. In T1DM, validating against 30-year outcomes
              data (DCCT) resulted in an R(2) of 0.72. In T2DM, validating
              against 20-year outcomes data (UKPDS) resulted in an R(2) of
              0.92. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis supports the CDM as a credible
              tool for predicting the absolute number of clinical events in
              DCCT- and UKPDS-like populations. With increasing incidence of
              diabetes worldwide, the CDM is particularly important for health
              care decision makers, for whom the robust evaluation of health
              care policies is essential.",

              splinter into multiple idea-imposition approaches; numerous

              hospitals who had reduced overall emergency department (ED)
              length of stay (LOS) in the 2 years following the introduction of
              the Ontario Emergency Room Wait Time Strategy were more likely to
              experience improvements in other measures of ED quality of care
              for three important conditions. METHODS: Retrospective medical
              record review using difference-in-differences analysis to compare
              changes in performance on quality indicators over the 3-year
              period between 11 Ontario hospitals where the median ED LOS had
              improved from fiscal year 2008 to 2010 and 13 matched sites where
              ED LOS was unchanged or worsened. Patients with acute myocardial
              infarction (AMI), asthma and paediatric and adult upper limb
              fractures in these hospitals in 2008 and 2010 were evaluated with
              respect to 18 quality indicators reflecting timeliness and
              safety/effectiveness of care in the ED. In a secondary analysis,
              we examined shift-level ED crowding at the time of the patient
              visit and performance on the quality indicators. RESULTS: Median
              ED LOS improved by up to 26\% (63 min) from 2008 to 2010 in the
              improved hospitals, and worsened by up to 47\% (91 min) in the
              unimproved sites. We abstracted 4319 and 4498 charts from
              improved and unimproved hospitals, respectively. Improvement in a
              hospital's overall median ED LOS from 2008 to 2010 was not
              associated with a change in any of the other ED quality
              indicators over the same time period. In our secondary analysis,
              shift-level crowding was associated only with indicators that
              reflected timeliness of care. During less crowded shifts,
              patients with AMI were more likely to be reperfused within target
              intervals (rate ratio 1.59, 95\% CI 1.03 to 2.45), patients with
              asthma more often received timely administration of steroids
              (rate ratio 1.88, 95\% CI 1.59 to 2.24) and beta-agonists (rate
              ratio 1.47, 95\% CI 1.25 to 1.74), and adult (but not paediatric)
              patients with fracture were more likely to receive analgesia or
              splinting within an hour (rate ratio 1.66, 95\% CI 1.22 to 2.26).
              CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a policy approach that
              targets only reductions in ED LOS is not associated with broader
              improvements in selected quality measures. At the same time,
              there is no evidence that efforts to address crowding have a
              detrimental effect on quality of care.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: This paper reports on findings from a systematic
              review designed to investigate the state of systems science
              research in public health. The objectives were to: (1) explore
              how systems methodologies are being applied within public health
              and (2) identify fruitful areas of activity. DESIGN: A systematic
              review was conducted from existing literature that draws on or
              uses systems science (in its various forms) and relates to key
              public health areas of action and concern, including tobacco,
              alcohol, obesity and the social determinants of health. DATA
              ANALYSIS: 117 articles were included in the review. An inductive
              qualitative content analysis was used for data extraction. The
              following were systematically extracted from the articles:
              approach, methodology, transparency, strengths and weaknesses.
              These were then organised according to theme (ie, commonalities
              between studies within each category), in order to provide an
              overview of the state of the field as a whole. The assessment of
              data quality was intrinsic to the goals of the review itself, and
              therefore, was carried out as part of the analysis. RESULTS: 4
              categories of research were identified from the review, ranging
              from editorial and commentary pieces to complex system dynamic
              modelling. Our analysis of each of these categories of research
              highlighted areas of potential for systems science to strengthen
              public health efforts, while also revealing a number of
              limitations in the dynamic systems modelling being carried out in
              public health. CONCLUSIONS: There is a great deal of interest in
              how the application of systems concepts and approach might aid
              public health. Our analysis suggests that soft systems modelling
              techniques are likely to be the most useful addition to public
              health, and align well with current debate around knowledge
              transfer and policy. However, the full range of systems
              methodologies is yet to be engaged with by public health

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Given the rapid changes in the communication
              landscape brought about by participative Internet use and social
              media, it is important to develop a better understanding of these
              technologies and their impact on health communication. The first
              step in this effort is to identify the characteristics of current
              social media users. Up-to-date reporting of current social media
              use will help monitor the growth of social media and inform
              health promotion/communication efforts aiming to effectively
              utilize social media. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study is to
              identify the sociodemographic and health-related factors
              associated with current adult social media users in the United
              States. METHODS: Data came from the 2007 iteration of the Health
              Information National Trends Study (HINTS, N = 7674). HINTS is a
              nationally representative cross-sectional survey on
              health-related communication trends and practices. Survey
              respondents who reported having accessed the Internet (N = 5078)
              were asked whether, over the past year, they had (1) participated
              in an online support group, (2) written in a blog, (3) visited a
              social networking site. Bivariate and multivariate logistic
              regression analyses were conducted to identify predictors of each
              type of social media use. RESULTS: Approximately 69\% of US
              adults reported having access to the Internet in 2007. Among
              Internet users, 5\% participated in an online support group, 7\%
              reported blogging, and 23\% used a social networking site.
              Multivariate analysis found that younger age was the only
              significant predictor of blogging and social networking site
              participation; a statistically significant linear relationship
              was observed, with younger categories reporting more frequent
              use. Younger age, poorer subjective health, and a personal cancer
              experience predicted support group participation. In general,
              social media are penetrating the US population independent of
              education, race/ethnicity, or health care access. CONCLUSIONS:
              Recent growth of social media is not uniformly distributed across
              age groups; therefore, health communication programs utilizing
              social media must first consider the age of the targeted
              population to help ensure that messages reach the intended
              audience. While racial/ethnic and health status-related
              disparities exist in Internet access, among those with Internet
              access, these characteristics do not affect social media use.
              This finding suggests that the new technologies, represented by
              social media, may be changing the communication pattern
              throughout the United States.",

  abstract = "This work is the first to take advantage of recurrent neural
              networks to predict influenza-like illness (ILI) dynamics from
              various linguistic signals extracted from social media data.
              Unlike other approaches that rely on timeseries analysis of
              historical ILI data and the state-of-the-art machine learning
              models, we build and evaluate the predictive power of neural
              network architectures based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTMs)
              units capable of nowcasting (predicting in ``real-time'') and
              forecasting (predicting the future) ILI dynamics in the 2011 -
              2014 influenza seasons. To build our models we integrate
              information people post in social media e.g., topics, embeddings,
              word ngrams, stylistic patterns, and communication behavior using
              hashtags and mentions. We then quantitatively evaluate the
              predictive power of different social media signals and contrast
              the performance of the-state-of-the-art regression models with
              neural networks using a diverse set of evaluation metrics.
              Finally, we combine ILI and social media signals to build a joint
              neural network model for ILI dynamics prediction. Unlike the
              majority of the existing work, we specifically focus on
              developing models for local rather than national ILI
              surveillance, specifically for military rather than general
              populations in 26 U.S. and six international locations., and
              analyze how model performance depends on the amount of social
              media data available per location. Our approach demonstrates
              several advantages: (a) Neural network architectures that rely on
              LSTM units trained on social media data yield the best
              performance compared to previously used regression models. (b)
              Previously under-explored language and communication behavior
              features are more predictive of ILI dynamics than stylistic and
              topic signals expressed in social media. (c) Neural network
              models learned exclusively from social media signals yield
              comparable or better performance to the models learned from ILI
              historical data, thus, signals from social media can be
              potentially used to accurately forecast ILI dynamics for the
              regions where ILI historical data is not available. (d) Neural
              network models learned from combined ILI and social media signals
              significantly outperform models that rely solely on ILI
              historical data, which adds to a great potential of alternative
              public sources for ILI dynamics prediction. (e) Location-specific
              models outperform previously used location-independent models
              e.g., U.S. only. (f) Prediction results significantly vary across
              geolocations depending on the amount of social media data
              available and ILI activity patterns. (g) Model performance
              improves with more tweets available per geo-location e.g., the
              error gets lower and the Pearson score gets higher for locations
              with more tweets.",

               is an important problem in data mining. Evolutionary
               undersampling of the majority class has proved to be a
               successful approach to tackle this issue. Such a challenging
               task may become even more difficult when the number of the
               majority class examples is very big. In this scenario, the use
               of the evolutionary model becomes unpractical due to the memory
               and time constrictions. Divide-and-conquer approaches based on
               the MapReduce paradigm have already been proposed to handle this
               type of problems by dividing data into multiple subsets.
               However, in extremely imbalanced cases, these models may suffer
               from a lack of density from the minority class in the subsets
               considered. Aiming at addressing this problem, in this
               contribution we provide a new big data scheme based on the new
               emerging technology Apache Spark to tackle highly imbalanced
               datasets. We take advantage of its in-memory operations to
               diminish the effect of the small sample size. The key point of
               this proposal lies in the independent management of majority and
               minority class examples, allowing us to keep a higher number of
               minority class examples in each subset. In our experiments, we
               analyze the proposed model with several data sets with up to 17
               million instances. The results show the goodness of this

              on a standardized and fixed collection of defining criteria, they
              often require revision to reflect new knowledge of the condition
              involved and improvements in diagnostic testing. Optimal case
              definitions also need to have a balance of sensitivity and
              specificity that reflects their intended use. After the 2009-2010
              H1N1 influenza pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO)
              initiated a technical consultation on global influenza
              surveillance. This prompted improvements in the sensitivity and
              specificity of the case definition for influenza - i.e. a
              respiratory disease that lacks uniquely defining symptomology.
              The revision process not only modified the definition of
              influenza-like illness, to include a simplified list of the
              criteria shown to be most predictive of influenza infection, but
              also clarified the language used for the definition, to enhance
              interpretability. To capture severe cases of influenza that
              required hospitalization, a new case definition was also
              developed for severe acute respiratory infection in all age
              groups. The new definitions have been found to capture more cases
              without compromising specificity. Despite the challenge still
              posed in the clinical separation of influenza from other
              respiratory infections, the global use of the new WHO case

              department performance indicator in England and one that drives
              the physical and organisational design of the ED. Some studies
              have identified time of presentation as a key factor affecting
              waiting times. Few studies have investigated other determinants
              of breaching the four-hour target. Therefore, our objective was
              to describe patterns of emergency department breaches of the
              four-hour wait time target and identify patients at highest risk
              of breaching. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of a
              large type 1 Emergency department at an NHS teaching hospital in
              Oxford, England. We analysed anonymised individual level patient
              data for 378,873 emergency department attendances, representing
              all attendances between April 2008 and April 2013. We examined
              patient characteristics and emergency department presentation
              circumstances associated with the highest likelihood of breaching
              the four-hour wait time target. RESULTS: We used 374,459 complete
              cases for analysis. In total, 8.3\% of all patients breached the
              four-hour wait time target. The main determinants of patients
              breaching the four-hour wait time target were hour of arrival to
              the ED, day of the week, patient age, ED referral source, and the
              types of investigations patients receive (p < 0.01 for all
              associations). Patients most likely to breach the four-hour
              target were older, presented at night, presented on Monday,
              received multiple types of investigation in the emergency
              department, and were not self-referred (p < 0.01 for all
              associations). Patients attending from October to February had a
              higher odds of breaching compared to those attending from March
              to September (OR 1.63, 95\% CI 1.59 to 1.66). CONCLUSIONS: There
              are a number of independent patient and circumstantial factors
              associated with the probability of breaching the four-hour ED
              wait time target including patient age, ED referral source, the
              types of investigations patients receive, as well as the hour,
              day, and month of arrival to the ED. Efforts to reduce the number
              of breaches could explore late-evening/overnight staffing, access

              perceptions in emergencies but can be costly and time consuming.
              We suggest and evaluate a complementary ``infoveillance''
              approach using Twitter during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Our study
              aimed to: 1) monitor the use of the terms ``H1N1'' versus ``swine
              flu'' over time; 2) conduct a content analysis of ``tweets''; and
              3) validate Twitter as a real-time content, sentiment, and public
              attention trend-tracking tool. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
              Between May 1 and December 31, 2009, we archived over 2 million
              Twitter posts containing keywords ``swine flu,'' ``swineflu,''
              and/or ``H1N1.'' using Infovigil, an infoveillance system. Tweets
              using ``H1N1'' increased from 8.8\% to 40.5\% (R(2) = .788;
              p<.001), indicating a gradual adoption of World Health
              Organization-recommended terminology. 5,395 tweets were randomly
              selected from 9 days, 4 weeks apart and coded using a tri-axial
              coding scheme. To track tweet content and to test the feasibility
              of automated coding, we created database queries for keywords and
              correlated these results with manual coding. Content analysis
              indicated resource-related posts were most commonly shared
              (52.6\%). 4.5\% of cases were identified as misinformation. News
              websites were the most popular sources (23.2\%), while government
              and health agencies were linked only 1.5\% of the time. 7/10
              automated queries correlated with manual coding. Several Twitter
              activity peaks coincided with major news stories. Our results
              correlated well with H1N1 incidence data. CONCLUSIONS: This study
              illustrates the potential of using social media to conduct
              ``infodemiology'' studies for public health. 2009 H1N1-related

  abstract = "This paper reviews the impact of health policies on hospital
              waiting times in the Netherlands over the last two decades.
              During the 1990s hospital waiting times increased as a result of
              the introduction of fixed budgets and capacity constraints for
              specialists, in addition to the fixed global hospital budgets
              that were already in place since the 1980s. To tackle these
              increased waiting times over the years 2000-2011 several policies
              were implemented, including a change from fixed budgets to
              activity-based funding--for both hospitals and specialists--and
              increased competition among hospitals. All together these
              measures resulted in a strong reduction of waiting times. In 2011
              mean expected waiting times for almost all surgical procedures
              varied from 2 to 6 weeks, well below the broadly accepted
              specified maximum waiting times. Hence, in the Netherlands

              is wait lists for surgery. The objective of this study is to
              report cross-sectional health data collected from a broad sample
              of patients awaiting elective surgery and shed light on potential
              non-surgical treatments to improve health. RESEARCH DESIGN:
              Prospective cross-sectional survey of patients newly enrolled on
              the surgical wait list in the Vancouver Coastal Health region.
              Multivariate regression models were used to estimate the
              associations between patient characteristics and health, pain and
              depression. MEASURES: Health status instruments were used to
              measure study participants' general health, pain, and depression
              immediately after they were enrolled on the wait list for one of
              the targeted elective surgeries. RESULTS: A majority of patients
              reported some problems with pain or discomfort, and a large
              portion reported problems associated with anxiety or depression.
              Orthopedic patients were significantly more likely to report
              problems with mobility, usual activities and pain/discomfort.
              Neurosurgery patients were the most likely to report significant
              and severe depression. CONCLUSIONS: The high rates of pain and
              depression not only have implications for patients' immediate
              health, but may also affect long-term surgical outcomes. This
              study draws attention to recognizing a wider array of morbidity,
              some potentially requiring non-surgical interventions, while
              patients wait for elective surgery. Policy options include
              re-examining the surgical triage system and expanding surgical
              capacity to match self-reported health.",

              operating room (OR) resources aimed at reducing time to surgery
              for non-elective orthopaedic inpatients at a Swedish hospital.
              METHODS: We applied discrete-event simulation modelling. The
              model was populated with real world data from a university
              hospital with a strong focus on reducing waiting time to surgery
              for patients with hip fracture. The system modelled concerned two
              patient groups that share the same OR resources: hip-fracture and
              other non-elective orthopaedic patients in need of surgical
              treatment. We simulated three scenarios based on the literature
              and interaction with staff and managers: (1) baseline; (2)
              reduced turnover time between surgeries by 20 min and (3) one
              extra OR during the day, Monday to Friday. The outcome variables
              were waiting time to surgery and the percentage of patients who
              waited longer than 24 hours for surgery. RESULTS: The mean
              waiting time in hours was significantly reduced from 16.2 hours
              in scenario 1 (baseline) to 13.3 hours in scenario 2 and 13.6
              hours in scenario 3 for hip-fracture surgery and from 26.0 hours
              in baseline to 18.9 hours in scenario 2 and 18.5 hours in
              scenario 3 for other non-elective patients. The percentage of
              patients who were treated within 24 hours significantly increased
              from 86.4\% (baseline) to 96.1\% (scenario 2) and 95.1\%
              (scenario 3) for hip-fracture patients and from 60.2\% (baseline)
              to 79.8\% (scenario 2) and 79.8\% (scenario 3) for patients with
              other non-elective patients. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare managers who
              strive to improve the timelines of non-elective orthopaedic
              surgeries may benefit from using simulation modelling to analyse
              different strategies to support their decisions. In this specific
              case, the simulation results showed that the reduction of surgery
              turnover times could yield the same results as an extra OR.",

              of the QUOROM (quality of reporting of meta-analysis) statement-a
              reporting guideline published in 1999-there have been several
              conceptual, methodological, and practical advances regarding the
              conduct and reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.
              Also, reviews of published systematic reviews have found that key
              information about these studies is often poorly reported.
              Realising these issues, an international group that included
              experienced authors and methodologists developed PRISMA
              (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and

              for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of evaluations of health

              Analytic modelling of observational studies investigating unsafe
              medical care in countries' inpatient care settings, stratified by
              national income, to identify incidence of seven adverse events
              for GBD modelling. Observational studies were generated through a
              comprehensive search of over 16 000 articles written in English
              after 1976, of which over 4000 were appropriate for full text
              review. RESULTS: The incidence, clinical outcomes, demographics
              and costs for each of the seven adverse events were collected
              from each publication when available. We used disability-adjusted
              life years (DALYs) lost as a standardised metric to measure
              morbidity and mortality due to specific adverse events. We
              estimate that there are 421 million hospitalisations in the world
              annually, and approximately 42.7 million adverse events. These
              adverse events result in 23 million DALYs lost per year.
              Approximately two-thirds of all adverse events, and the DALYs
              lost from them, occurred in low-income and middle-income
              countries. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides early evidence that
              adverse events due to medical care represent a major source of
              morbidity and mortality globally. Though suffering related to the
              lack of access to care in many countries remains, these findings
              suggest the importance of critically evaluating the quality and
              safety of the care provided once a person accesses health
              services. While further refinements of the estimates are needed,
              these data should be a call to global health policymakers to make

              to adapt their resources to rising levels of demand. The main
              focus of this study was to help prioritise planned investments in
              new capacity allowing the service to improve patient experience
              and meet future anticipated demand. METHODS: We developed
              computer models of patient flows in an obesity service in an
              Academic Health Science Centre that provides lifestyle,
              pharmacotherapy and surgery treatment options for the UK's
              National Health Service. Using these models we experiment with
              different scenarios to investigate the likely impact of
              alternative resource configurations on patient waiting times.
              RESULTS: Simulation results show that the timing and combination
              of adding extra resources (eg, surgeons and physicians) to the
              service are important. For example, increasing the capacity of
              the pharmacotherapy clinics equivalent to adding one physician
              reduced the relevant waiting list size and waiting times, but it
              then led to increased waiting times for surgical patients. Better
              service levels were achieved when the service operates with the
              resource capacity of two physicians and three surgeons. The
              results obtained from this study had an impact on the planning
              and organisation of the obesity service. CONCLUSIONS: Resource
              configuration combined with demand management (reduction in
              referral rates) along the care service can help improve patient
              waiting time targets for obesity services, such as the 18 week
              target of UK's National Health Service. The use of simulation
              models can help stakeholders understand the interconnectedness of
              the multiple microsystems (eg, clinics) comprising a complex
              clinical service for the same patient population, therefore,
              making stakeholders aware of the likely impact of resourcing
              decisions on the different microsystems.",

               flexible and necessarily detailed capacity models are needed.
               The development and use of such a simulation model is presented
               in this paper. The modelling work, in conjunction with a major
               UK NHS Trust, considers various types of patient flows, at the
               individual patient level, and resulting bed needs over time. The
               consequence of changes in capacity planning policies and
               management of existing capacities can be readily examined. The
               work has highlighted the need for evaluating hospital bed
               capacities in light of both bed occupancies and refused
               admission rates. The relationship between occupancy and refusals
               is complex and often overlooked by hospital managers.",

              patient arrival rates necessitates the adjustment of staffing
              patterns to optimize the timely care of patients. This study
              evaluated the effectiveness of a queueing model in identifying
              provider staffing patterns to reduce the fraction of patients who
              leave without being seen. METHODS: The authors collected detailed
              ED arrival data from an urban hospital and used a Lag SIPP
              queueing analysis to gain insights on how to change provider
              staffing to decrease the proportion of patients who leave without
              being seen. The authors then compared this proportion for the
              same 39-week period before and after the resulting changes.
              RESULTS: Despite an increase in arrival volume of 1,078 patients
              (6.3\%), an average increase in provider hours of 12 hours per
              week (3.1\%) resulted in 258 fewer patients who left without
              being seen. This represents a decrease in the proportion of
              patients who left without being seen by 22.9\%. Restricting
              attention to a four-day subset of the week during which there was
              no increase in total provider hours, a reallocation of providers
              based on the queueing model resulted in 161 fewer patients who
              left without being seen (21.7\%), despite an additional 548
              patients (5.5\%) arriving in the second half of the study.
              CONCLUSIONS: Timely access to a provider is a critical dimension
              of ED quality performance. In an environment in which EDs are
              often understaffed, analyses of arrival patterns and the use of

              coincided with dramatic increases in emergency department (ED)
              visit rates, both in the United States and around the world. ED
              crowding has become a public health problem where periodic supply
              and demand mismatches in ED and hospital resources cause long
              waiting times and delays in critical treatments. ED crowding has
              been associated with several negative clinical outcomes,
              including higher complication rates and mortality. This article
              describes emergency care systems and the extent of crowding
              across 15 countries outside of the United States: Australia,
              Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India,
              Iran, Italy, The Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Catalonia (Spain),
              Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The authors are local emergency
              care leaders with knowledge of emergency care in their particular
              countries. Where available, data are provided about visit
              patterns in each country; however, for many of these countries,
              no national data are available on ED visits rates or crowding.
              For most of the countries included, there is both objective
              evidence of increases in ED visit rates and ED crowding and also
              subjective assessments of trends toward higher crowding in the
              ED. ED crowding appears to be worsening in many countries despite
              the presence of universal health coverage. Scandinavian countries
              with robust systems to manage acute care outside the ED do not
              report crowding is a major problem. The main cause for crowding
              identified by many authors is the boarding of admitted patients,
              similar to the United States. Many hospitals in these countries
              have implemented operational interventions to mitigate crowding
              in the ED, and some countries have imposed strict limits on ED
              length of stay (LOS), while others have no clear plan to mitigate
              crowding. An understanding of the causes and potential solutions
              implemented in these countries can provide a lens into how to
              mitigate ED crowding in the United States through health policy
              interventions and hospital operational changes.",

              times and to compare these between ED site volumes. METHODS: This
              study was a retrospective consecutive sample of ED patients at
              one hospital system with four EDs. The wait times of 8,889
              patients were included in this analysis. One ED was in a large
              teaching hospital with 5,000 ED patients per month; the other
              three were freestanding or community EDs without teaching and
              with fewer than 2,000 ED patients per month each. The publicly
              posted ED wait times at the time of patient arrival were recorded
              and compared to the actual wait times as retrieved from the ED
              tracking system. The difference between posted and actual wait
              times for each site was calculated. Separate one-way analysis of
              variance (ANOVA) tests with post hoc testing were conducted to
              assess actual wait time and wait time difference between ED
              sites. RESULTS: Mean and standard deviation (SD) wait time
              difference at the main ED with a volume of 5,000 patients per
              month was 31.5 ($\pm$61.2) minutes. At the facilities with fewer
              than 2,000 ED patients per month each, the differences in wait
              times were 4.2 ($\pm$21.8), 8.6 ($\pm$23.8), and 1.3 ($\pm$11.9)
              minutes. ANOVA results revealed that the main ED had
              significantly different actual wait time and wait time
              differences (p < 0.05) when compared to the other three EDs.
              CONCLUSIONS: In one hospital system, publicly posted ED wait
              times show better accuracy in EDs that see 2,000 or fewer
              patients per month and less accuracy for an ED that sees 5,000
              patients per month, likely due to flow confounders.",

              cut-offs leading to 19 potential screening algorithms. DATA
              SOURCES: The computer simulation was populated with data from the

              costs for healthcare interventions, and a population of 110 948

              MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost effectiveness ratios, incremental
              cost effectiveness ratios, and screening options' outcomes.
              RESULTS: The contingent screening strategy dominated all other
              screening options: it had the best cost effectiveness ratio
              ($C26,833 per case of Down's syndrome) with fewer procedure
              related euploid miscarriages and unnecessary terminations
              (respectively, 6 and 16 per 100,000 pregnancies). It also
              outperformed serum screening at the second trimester. In terms of
              the incremental cost effectiveness ratio, contingent screening
              was still dominant: compared with screening based on maternal age
              alone, the savings were $C30,963 per additional birth with Down's
              syndrome averted. Contingent screening was the only screening
              strategy that offered early reassurance to the majority of women
              (77.81\%) in first trimester and minimised costs by limiting
              retesting during the second trimester (21.05\%). For the
              contingent and sequential screening strategies, the choice of
              cut-off value for risk in the first trimester test significantly
              affected the cost effectiveness ratios (respectively, from
              $C26,833 to $C37,260 and from $C35,215 to $C45,314 per case of
              Down's syndrome), the number of procedure related euploid

              to 26 and from 16 to 25 per 100,000 pregnancies). CONCLUSIONS:
              Contingent screening, with a first trimester cut-off value for

              ``social influences'' model is known to reduce smoking among
              youth by 5-56\%. Program effectiveness, however, dissipates in
              1-4 years. Consequently, opinion leaders have questioned whether
              a more intensive national educational effort would be
              economically efficient. To address this question, we evaluated
              the cost-effectiveness of enhanced nationwide school-based
              anti-tobacco education relative to the status quo. METHODS: To
              estimate cost-effectiveness, we created the Tobacco Policy Model,
              a system dynamics computer simulation model. The model relies on
              secondary data and is designed to calculate the expected costs
              and public health gains of any tobacco policy or intervention
              over any time frame. RESULTS: Over 50 years, cost-effectiveness
              is estimated to lie between \$4,900 and \$340,000 per
              quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), depending on the degree and
              longevity of program effectiveness. Assuming a 30\% effectiveness
              that dissipates in 4 years, cost-effectiveness is \$20,000/QALY.
              Sensitivity analysis reveals that cost-effectiveness varies with
              cost, survival, and quality-of-life estimates but
              cost-effectiveness ratios generally remain favorable.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Following the landmark lawsuit and settlement with
              the tobacco industry, Minnesota pursued the implementation of
              stricter tobacco control policies, including tax increases, mass
              media campaigns, smokefree air laws, and cessation treatment
              policies. Modeling is used to examine policy effects on smoking
              prevalence and smoking-attributable deaths. PURPOSE: To estimate
              the effect of tobacco control policies in Minnesota on smoking
              prevalence and smoking-attributable deaths using the SimSmoke
              simulation model. METHODS: Minnesota data starting in 1993 are
              applied to SimSmoke, a simulation model used to examine the
              effect of tobacco control policies over time on smoking
              initiation and cessation. Upon validating the model against
              smoking prevalence, SimSmoke is used to distinguish the effect of
              policies implemented since 1993 on smoking prevalence. Using
              standard attribution methods, SimSmoke also estimates deaths
              averted as a result of the policies. RESULTS: SimSmoke predicts
              smoking prevalence accurately between 1993 and 2011. Since 1993,
              a relative reduction in smoking rates of 29\% by 2011 and of 41\%
              by 2041 can be attributed to tobacco control policies, mainly tax
              increases, smokefree air laws, media campaigns, and cessation
              treatment programs. Moreover, 48,000 smoking-attributable deaths
              will be averted by 2041. CONCLUSIONS: Minnesota SimSmoke
              demonstrates that tobacco control policies, especially taxes,
              have substantially reduced smoking prevalence and
              smoking-attributable deaths. Taxes, smokefree air laws, mass
              media, cessation treatment policies, and youth-access enforcement

              Prevention (CDC) recommend routine HIV counseling, testing, and
              referral (HIVCTR) in settings with at least a 1 percent
              prevalence of HIV, roughly 280,000 Americans are unaware of their
              human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The effect of
              expanded screening for HIV is unknown in the era of effective
              antiretroviral therapy. METHODS: We developed a computer
              simulation model of HIV screening and treatment to compare
              routine, voluntary HIVCTR with current practice in three target
              populations: ``high-risk'' (3.0 percent prevalence of undiagnosed
              HIV infection; 1.2 percent annual incidence); ``CDC threshold''
              (1.0 percent and 0.12 percent, respectively); and ``U.S.
              general'' (0.1 percent and 0.01 percent). Input data were derived
              from clinical trials and observational cohorts. Outcomes included
              quality-adjusted survival, cost, and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS:
              In the high-risk population, the addition of one-time screening
              for HIV antibodies with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
              (ELISA) to current practice was associated with earlier diagnosis
              of HIV (mean CD4 cell count at diagnosis, 210 vs. 154 per cubic
              millimeter). One-time screening also improved average survival
              time among HIV-infected patients (quality-adjusted survival,
              220.7 months vs. 219.8 months). The incremental
              cost-effectiveness was 36,000 dollars per quality-adjusted
              life-year gained. Testing every five years cost 50,000 dollars
              per quality-adjusted life-year gained, and testing every three
              years cost 63,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained.
              In the CDC threshold population, the cost-effectiveness ratio for
              one-time screening with ELISA was 38,000 dollars per
              quality-adjusted life-year gained, whereas testing every five
              years cost 71,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained,
              and testing every three years cost 85,000 dollars per
              quality-adjusted life-year gained. In the U.S. general
              population, one-time screening cost 113,000 dollars per
              quality-adjusted life-year gained. CONCLUSIONS: In all but the
              lowest-risk populations, routine, voluntary screening for HIV
              once every three to five years is justified on both clinical and
              cost-effectiveness grounds. One-time screening in the general
              population may also be cost-effective.",

              screening interval, and total number of scheduled screening
              examinations (i.e., Pap smears). We compared the efficiency of
              cervical cancer-screening programs by performing a
              cost-effectiveness analysis of cervical cancer-screening policies
              from high-income countries. METHODS: We used the microsimulation
              screening analysis (MISCAN) program to model and determine the
              costs and effects of almost 500 screening policies, some
              fictitious and some actual (i.e., recommended by national
              guidelines). The costs (in U.S. dollars) and effects (in years of
              life gained) were compared for each policy to identify the most
              efficient policies. RESULTS: There were 15 efficient screening
              policies (i.e., no alternative policy exists that results in more
              life-years gained for lower costs). For these policies, which
              considered two to 40 total scheduled examinations, the age range
              expanded gradually from 40-52 years to 20-80 years as the
              screening interval decreased from 12 to 1.5 years. For the
              efficient policies, the predicted gain in life expectancy ranged
              from 11.6 to 32.4 days, compared with a gain of 46 days if
              cervical cancer mortality were eliminated entirely. The average
              cost-effectiveness ratios increased from $6700 (for the longest
              screening interval) to $23 900 per life-year gained. For some
              countries, the recommended screening policies were close to
              efficient, but the cost-effectiveness could be improved by
              reducing the number of scheduled examinations, starting them at
              later ages, or lengthening the screening interval. CONCLUSIONS:
              The basis for the diversity in the screening policies among
              high-income countries does not appear to relate to the screening
              policies' cost-effectiveness ratios, which are highly sensitive
              to the number of Pap smears offered during a lifetime.",

              systematic evaluation of the relative expenses and projected
              benefit of combining these two screening modalities is not

              duration of the disease, age-specific sensitivities of the two
              modalities, age-specific incidence of the disease, screening
              strategy, and competing causes of mortality. We examined a total
              of 48 screening strategies, depending on the age range, the
              examination interval, and whether mammography or CBE is given at
              every one or two exam. Our results indicate that a biennial
              mammography can be cost-effective if coupled with annual CBE. For
              each screening interval and starting age, giving mammography
              every two exams and CBE at every exam has the lowest marginal
              cost per year of quality-adjusted life saved, whereas giving both

              CBE to biennial mammography and annual CBE from 50 to 79, the
              total cost was reduced by 35\%, whereas the marginal
              quality-adjusted life years only decreased by 12\%. Similar
              reductions are observed for other starting ages. It is
              cost-effective to have a biennial mammography if coupled with an
              annual CBE. Annual mammography combined with CBE every 6 months
              will lead to a 41\% increase in the quality-adjusted life years

              model estimates the future demand for RRT in England in 2010 for
              a range of scenarios. The model uses current prevalence and
              current and projected future acceptance rates, survival rates and
              the transitions between modalities to predict future patient
              numbers. National population and mortality data, published
              literature and data from the UK Renal Registry and UK Transplant,
              are used to estimate unmet need for RRT, the impact of changing
              demography and incidence of Type 2 diabetes, patient
              haemodialysis (HD) survival and transplant supply. RESULTS: By
              2010 the predicted prevalence will have increased from about
              30,000 in 2000 to between 42 and 51,000 (900-1000 p.m.p.), an
              average annual growth of 4.5-6\%. Changing transplant supply has
              a small effect on overall numbers but changes the proportion of

              used a stochastic model with proxies of age-dependent biology to
              evaluate the incremental U.S. societal costs and benefits of
              biennial screening from age 50 until age 70, 79, or lifetime.
              MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Discounted incremental costs per life
              years saved (LYS). RESULTS: Lifetime screening is expensive
              (151,434 dollars per LYS) if women have treatment and survival
              comparable to clinical trials (idealized); stopping at age 79
              costs 82,063 dollars per LYS. This latter result corresponds to
              costs associated with an LE of 9.5 years at age 79, a value
              expected for 75\% of 79-year-olds, about 50\% of 80-year-olds,
              and 25\% of 85-year-olds. Using actual treatment and survival
              patterns, screening benefits are greater, and lifetime screening
              of all women might be considered (114,905 dollars per LYS),
              especially for women in the top 25\% of LE for their age (50,643
              dollars per LYS, life expectancy of approximately 7 years at age
              90). CONCLUSIONS: If all women receive idealized treatment, the
              benefits of mammography beyond age 79 are too low relative to
              their costs to justify continued screening. However, if treatment
              is not ideal, extending screening beyond age 79 could be

              years be offered HIV testing in routine medical care settings.
              Past studies report the clinical outcomes, cost-effectiveness,
              and budget impact of expanded HIV testing nationally and within
              clinics but have not examined how state policies affect resource
              needs and epidemic outcomes. METHODS: A system dynamics model of
              HIV testing and care was developed, where disease progression and
              transmission differ by awareness of HIV status, engagement in
              care, and disease stage. Data sources include HIV surveillance,
              Medicaid claims, and literature. The model projected how
              alternate implementation scenarios would change new infections,
              diagnoses, linkage to care, and living HIV cases over 10 years.
              RESULTS: Without the law, the model projects declining new
              infections, newly diagnosed cases, individuals newly linked to
              care, and fraction of undiagnosed cases (reductions of 62.8\%,
              59.7\%, 54.1\%, and 57.8\%) and a slight increase in living
              diagnosed cases and individuals in care (2.2\% and 6.1\%). The
              law will further reduce new infections, diagnosed AIDS cases, and
              the fraction undiagnosed and initially increase and then decrease
              newly diagnosed cases. Outcomes were consistent across scenarios
              with different testing offer frequencies and implementation times

              of preparations for the next influenza pandemic, sufficient
              influenza antiviral drugs to treat approximately 25\% of their
              populations. Our aim is two-fold: first, since in many countries
              the antiviral stockpile is well below this level, we search for
              suboptimal strategies based on treatment provided only to an
              age-dependent fraction of cases. Second, since in some countries
              the stockpile exceeds the suggested minimum level, we search for
              optimal strategies for post-exposure prophylactic treatment of
              close contacts of cases. METHODS: We used a stochastic, spatially
              structured individual-based model, considering explicit
              transmission in households, schools and workplaces, to simulate
              the spatiotemporal spread of an influenza pandemic in Italy and
              to evaluate the efficacy of interventions based on
              age-prioritized use of antivirals. RESULTS: Our results show that
              the antiviral stockpile required for treatment of cases ranges
              from 10\% to 35\% of the population for R0 in 1.4 - 3. No
              suboptimal strategies, based on treatment provided to an

              provided to younger individuals is the only intervention
              resulting in a significant reduction of the clinical attack rate
              and requiring a relatively small stockpile of antivirals.
              CONCLUSION: Our results strongly suggest that governments
              stockpile sufficient influenza antiviral drugs to treat
              approximately 25\% of their populations, under the assumption
              that R0 is not much larger than 2. In countries where the number
              of antiviral stockpiled exceeds the suggested minimum level,
              providing prophylaxis to younger individuals is an option that
              could be taken into account in preparedness plans. In countries
              where the number of antivirals stockpiled is well below 25\% of
              the population, priority should be decided based on age-specific
              case fatality rates. However, late detection of cases
              (administration of antivirals 48 hours after the clinical onset
              of symptoms) dramatically affects the efficacy of both treatment
              and prophylaxis.",

              (HRSA's) Health Workforce Simulation Model (HWSM) and examining
              the HWSM's 2025 supply and demand projections for primary care
              physicians, nurse practitioners (NPs), and physician assistants
              (PAs). DATA SOURCES: HRSA's recently published projections for
              primary care providers derive from an integrated microsimulation
              model that estimates health workforce supply and demand at
              national, regional, and state levels. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
              Thirty-seven states are projected to have shortages of primary
              care physicians in 2025, and nine states are projected to have
              shortages of both primary care physicians and PAs. While no state
              is projected to have a 2025 shortage of primary care NPs, many
              states are expected to have only a small surplus. CONCLUSIONS:
              Primary care physician shortages are projected for all parts of
              the United States, while primary care PA shortages are generally
              confined to Midwestern and Southern states. No state is projected
              to have shortages of all three provider types. Projected

               the economic and health consequences in the UK of implanting a
               CRT in patients with NYHA class III-IV heart failure.Methods: A

               one receiving both CRT and optimum pharmacologic treatment
               (OPT), the other OPT alone. All inputs were obtained from the
               data collected in the CArdiac REsynchronization in Heart Failure
               (CARE-HF) trial and a hospital in the UK. Direct medical costs
               (in 2004 \pounds{}) from the perspective of the National Health
               Service were considered. Both costs and benefits were discounted
               at 3.5\%. Sensitivity analyses addressed all model inputs and
               multivariate analyses were performed by varying key parameters
               simultaneously.Results: The model predicted 471 deaths and 2263
               hospitalizations over 5 years with OPT alone and 348 deaths and
               1764 hospitalizations with CRT, equivalent to a 26\% reduction

               of \pounds{}11?423 per patient with CRT vs. \pounds{}4900 with
               OPT alone. CRT was predicted to increase quality-adjusted

              PATIENTS/SETTINGS: Patients experiencing acute myocardial
              infarction in England. INTERVENTIONS: Improving the ambulance
              response time to 75\% of calls reached within 8 minutes and the
              hospital arrival to thrombolysis time interval (door-to-needle
              time) to 75\% receiving it within 30 minutes and 20 minutes,
              compared to best estimates of response times in the mid-1990s.
              MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Deaths prevented, life years saved, and
              discounted cost per life year saved. RESULTS: Improving the
              ambulance response to 75\% of calls within 8 minutes resulted in
              an estimate of 5 deaths prevented or 57 life years saved per
              million population per year, with a discounted incremental cost
              per life year saved of 8540 pounds sterling over 20 years. The
              corresponding benefit of improving the door-to-needle time to
              75\% of myocardial infarction patients within 30 minutes was an
              estimated 2 deaths prevented and 15 life years saved per million

              year saved of between 10,150 pounds sterling to 54,230 pounds

              reaching the 20 minute target. Combining ambulance and
              thrombolysis targets resulted in 70 life years saved per million
              population per year. CONCLUSIONS: Improving ambulance response
              times appears to be cost effective. Reducing door-to-needle time
              will have a smaller effect at an uncertain cost. Further benefits

              for the population aged 50 years or older in five regions of
              Spain (45.7\% of the population). Different scenarios of worse

              childhood varicella vaccination, with the Oka/Merck varicella
              zoster virus vaccine live (Varivax) in Italy. METHODS: This
              analysis is based on an epidemiological model of varicella zoster
              virus (VZV) dynamics adapted to the Italian situation. Cost data
              (Euro, 2002 values) were collected through a literature review.
              Several vaccination scenarios were analysed: (i) routine
              vaccination programme for children aged 1-2 years with different
              levels of vaccination coverage (90\%, 70\% and 45\%) without any
              catch-up programme; (ii) routine vaccination programme for
              children aged 1-2 years with different levels of vaccination
              coverage (90\%, 70\% and 45\%) completed by a catch-up programme
              for 6-year-old children over the first 5 years of vaccine
              marketing; and (iii) routine vaccination programme for children
              aged 1-2 years with different levels of vaccination coverage
              (90\%, 70\% and 45\%) completed by a catch-up programme during
              the first year of vaccine marketing for children aged 2-11 years.
              PERSPECTIVES: A societal perspective, including both direct and
              indirect costs, and a health-system perspective, limited to costs
              supported by Italian Health Authorities, were considered.
              RESULTS: A routine vaccination programme has a clearly positive
              impact on chickenpox morbidity. Respectively, 68\% and 57\% of
              chickenpox-related hospitalisations and deaths could be prevented
              with a 90\% coverage rate. With vaccination costs being more than
              offset by a reduction in chickenpox treatment costs in the base
              case, such a programme could also induce savings from both a
              societal and a health-system perspective (40\% and 12\% savings,
              respectively for a 90\% coverage rate). A lower coverage rate
              reduces cost savings, but there is still a 9\% decrease in
              overall societal costs for a 45\% coverage rate. Although the
              reduction in total societal costs was robust to the sensitivity
              analyses performed, a slight uncertainty remains regarding cost
              reduction from a health-system perspective. However, in this
              latter perspective, even in the worst-case scenario of the
              sensitivity analysis, routine vaccination programmes may be cost
              effective, the worst-case scenario for cost parameters leading to
              cost per life-year gained of Euro2853. Catch-up programmes
              combined with routine vaccination should lead to further cost
              reductions from a societal perspective: 15\% for a massive
              catch-up during the first year of vaccine marketing compared with
              toddlers' vaccination alone, and 11\% for a catch-up focused on
              6-year-old children for a period of 5 years. However, the impact
              of catch-up programmes on the costs from an Italian health-system
              perspective remains close to zero (+/-1\%). CONCLUSION: This
              model suggests, with its underlying assumptions and data, that
              routine ZVZ vaccination may be cost saving from both a societal
              and a health system perspective in the base case. In the
              worst-case scenario of the sensitivity analysis, vaccination
              remains cost effective.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The Xpert MTB/RIF test enables rapid detection of
              tuberculosis (TB) and rifampicin resistance. The World Health
              Organization recommends Xpert for initial diagnosis in
              individuals suspected of having multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB)
              or HIV-associated TB, and many countries are moving quickly
              toward adopting Xpert. As roll-out proceeds, it is essential to
              understand the potential health impact and cost-effectiveness of
              diagnostic strategies based on Xpert. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We
              evaluated potential health and economic consequences of
              implementing Xpert in five southern African countries--Botswana,
              Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland--where drug
              resistance and TB-HIV coinfection are prevalent. Using a
              calibrated, dynamic mathematical model, we compared the status
              quo diagnostic algorithm, emphasizing sputum smear, against an
              algorithm incorporating Xpert for initial diagnosis. Results were
              projected over 10- and 20-y time periods starting from 2012.
              Compared to status quo, implementation of Xpert would avert
              132,000 (95\% CI: 55,000-284,000) TB cases and 182,000
              (97,000-302,000) TB deaths in southern Africa over the 10 y
              following introduction, and would reduce prevalence by 28\%
              (14\%-40\%) by 2022, with more modest reductions in incidence.
              Health system costs are projected to increase substantially with
              Xpert, by US$460 million (294-699 million) over 10 y.
              Antiretroviral therapy for HIV represents a substantial fraction
              of these additional costs, because of improved survival in
              TB/HIV-infected populations through better TB case-finding and
              treatment. Costs for treating MDR-TB are also expected to rise
              significantly with Xpert scale-up. Relative to status quo, Xpert
              has an estimated cost-effectiveness of US$959 (633-1,485) per
              disability-adjusted life-year averted over 10 y. Across
              countries, cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from US$792
              (482-1,785) in Swaziland to US$1,257 (767-2,276) in Botswana.
              Assessing outcomes over a 10-y period focuses on the near-term
              consequences of Xpert adoption, but the cost-effectiveness
              results are conservative, with cost-effectiveness ratios assessed
              over a 20-y time horizon approximately 20\% lower than the 10-y
              values. CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of Xpert could substantially
              change TB morbidity and mortality through improved case-finding
              and treatment, with more limited impact on long-term transmission
              dynamics. Despite extant uncertainty about TB natural history and
              intervention impact in southern Africa, adoption of Xpert
              evidently offers reasonable value for its cost, based on
              conventional benchmarks for cost-effectiveness. However, the

              UK implemented stricter tobacco control policies, including a
              comprehensive cessation treatment programme. We evaluate their
              effect. METHODS: Data for the UK (excluding Northern Ireland) are
              applied to 'SimSmoke', a simulation model used to examine the
              effect of tobacco control policies over time on smoking
              initiation and cessation. Upon validating the model against
              smoking prevalence, the model is used to distinguish the effect
              of policies implemented between 1998 and 2009 on smoking
              prevalence. Using standard attribution methods, the model
              estimates lives saved as a result of policies. RESULTS: The model
              predicts smoking prevalence accurately between 1998 and 2009. A
              relative reduction of 23\% in smoking rates over that period is
              attributed to tobacco control policies, mainly tax increases,
              smoke-free air laws, advertising restrictions and cessation
              treatment programmes. The model estimates that 210 000 deaths
              will be averted by the year 2040, as a consequence of policies
              implemented between 1998 and 2010. CONCLUSIONS: The results
              document the UK's success in reducing smoking prevalence and
              prolonging lives, thereby providing an example for other European
              nations. When Framework Convention for Tobacco Control- (FCTC)

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: A wide range of possible malaria vaccines is being
              considered and there is a need to identify which vaccines should
              be prioritized for clinical development. An important element of
              the information needed for this prioritization is a prediction of
              the cost-effectiveness of potential vaccines in the transmission
              settings in which they are likely to be deployed. This analysis
              needs to consider a range of delivery modalities to ensure that
              clinical development plans can be aligned with the most
              appropriate deployment strategies. METHODS: The simulations are
              based on a previously published individual-based stochastic model
              for the natural history and epidemiology of Plasmodium falciparum
              malaria. Three different vaccine types: pre-erythrocytic vaccines
              (PEV), blood stage vaccines (BSV), mosquito-stage
              transmission-blocking vaccines (MSTBV), and combinations of
              these, are considered each delivered via a range of delivery
              modalities (Expanded Programme of Immunization - EPI-, EPI with
              booster, and mass vaccination combined with EPI). The
              cost-effectiveness ratios presented are calculated for four
              health outcomes, for assumed vaccine prices of US$ 2 or US$ 10
              per dose, projected over a 10-year period. RESULTS: The
              simulations suggest that PEV will be more cost-effective in low
              transmission settings, while BSV at higher transmission settings.
              Combinations of BSV and PEV are more efficient than PEV,
              especially in moderate to high transmission settings, while
              compared to BSV they are more cost-effective in moderate to low
              transmission settings. Combinations of MSTBV and PEV or PEV and
              BSV improve the effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness compared
              to PEV and BSV alone only when applied with EPI and mass
              vaccinations. Adding booster doses to the EPI is unlikely to be a
              cost-effective alternative to delivering vaccines via the EPI for
              any vaccine, while mass vaccination improves effectiveness,
              especially in low transmission settings, and is often a more
              efficient alternative to the EPI. However, the costs of
              increasing the coverage of mass vaccination over 50\% often
              exceed the benefits. CONCLUSION: The simulations indicate malaria
              vaccines might be efficient malaria control interventions, and
              that both transmission setting and vaccine delivery modality are
              important to their cost-effectiveness. Alternative vaccine
              delivery modalities to the EPI may be more efficient than the
              EPI. Mass vaccination is predicted to provide substantial health
              benefits at low additional costs, although achieving high
              coverage rates can lead to substantial incremental costs.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Infectious diseases and
              antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms are a growing problem for
              the dialysis population. The frequency of patient visits and
              intimate, prolonged physical contact with the inanimate
              environment during dialysis treatments make these facilities
              potentially efficient venues for nosocomial pathogen
              transmission. Isolation measures and infection control practices
              can be inconvenient and consume limited resources. Quantitative
              tools for analyzing the effects of different containment
              strategies can help to identify optimal strategies for further
              study. However, spatial and temporal considerations germane to
              the dialysis unit greatly complicate analyses relying on
              conventional mathematical approaches. DESIGN, SETTING,
              PARTICIPANTS, \& MEASUREMENTS: A stochastic, individual-based,
              Monte Carlo simulation tool that predicts the effects of various
              infection control strategies on pathogen dissemination through
              the dialysis unit in the face of diagnostic uncertainty was
              developed. The model was configured to emulate a medium-sized
              dialysis unit. The predicted consequences of various policies for
              scheduling patients who were suspected of being infectious were
              then explored, using literature-based estimates of pathogen
              transmissibility, prevalence, and diagnostic uncertainty.
              RESULTS: Environmental decontamination was predicted to be of
              paramount importance in limiting pathogen dissemination. Temporal
              segregation (scheduling patients who were suspected of being
              infectious to dialysis shifts that are later in the day) was
              predicted to have the greatest effectiveness in reducing
              transmission, given adequate environmental decontamination
              between successive days. CONCLUSIONS: Decontamination of the
              patient's environment (chair) can markedly attenuate pathogen
              dissemination. Temporal segregation could be a simple, low-cost,
              system-level intervention with significant potential to reduce
              nosocomial transmission in the dialysis unit.",

              relative to film mammography screening. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate
              the cost-effectiveness of digital mammography screening for
              breast cancer. DESIGN: Validated, discrete-event simulation
              model. DATA SOURCES: Data from DMIST and publicly available U.S.
              data. TARGET POPULATION: U.S. women age 40 years or older. TIME
              HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal and Medicare.
              INTERVENTION: All-film mammography screening; all-digital
              mammography screening; and targeted digital mammography
              screening, which is age-targeted digital mammography (for women
              or =50 years of age with dense breasts). OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost
              per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS OF
              BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: All-digital mammography screening cost
              \$331,000 (95\% CI, \$268,000 to \$403,000) per QALY gained
              relative to all-film mammography screening but was more costly
              and less effective than targeted digital mammography screening.
              Targeted digital mammography screening resulted in more
              screen-detected cases of cancer and fewer deaths from cancer than
              either all-film or all-digital mammography screening, with
              cost-effectiveness estimates ranging from \$26,500 (CI, \$21,000
              to \$33,000) per QALY gained for age-targeted digital mammography
              to \$84,500 (CI, \$75,000 to \$93,000) per QALY gained for age-
              and density-targeted digital mammography. In the Medicare
              population, the cost-effectiveness of density-targeted digital
              mammography screening varied from a base-case estimate of
              \$97,000 (CI, \$77,000 to \$131,000) to \$257,000 per QALY gained
              (CI, \$91,000 to \$536,000) in the alternative-case analyses, in
              which the sensitivity of film mammography was increased and the
              sensitivity of digital mammography in women with nondense breasts
              was decreased. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results were
              sensitive to the cost of digital mammography and to the
              prevalence of dense breasts. LIMITATIONS: Results were dependent
              on model assumptions and DMIST findings. CONCLUSION: Relative to
              film mammography, screening for breast cancer by using
              all-digital mammography is not cost-effective. Age-targeted
              screening with digital mammography seems cost-effective, whereas
              density-targeted screening strategies are more costly and of
              uncertain value, particularly among women age 65 years or older.",

              model of hepatitis A transmission dynamics to evaluate two
              policies of administering a two-dose hepatitis A vaccine to
              children aged 12 to 18 months: 1) universal routine vaccination
              as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization
              Practices in 2006 and 2) Advisory Committee on Immunization
              Practices's previous regional policy of routine vaccination of
              children living in states with high hepatitis A incidence. Inputs
              were obtained from the published literature, public sources, and
              clinical trial data. The model was fitted to hepatitis A
              seroprevalence (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
              II and III) and reported incidence from the National Notifiable
              Diseases Surveillance System (1980-1995). We used a societal
              perspective and projected costs (in 2013 US $), quality-adjusted
              life-years, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, and other
              outcomes over the period 2006 to 2106. RESULTS: On average,
              universal routine hepatitis A vaccination prevented 259,776
              additional infections, 167,094 outpatient visits, 4781

              regional vaccination policy, universal routine hepatitis A
              vaccination was cost saving. In scenario analysis, universal
              vaccination prevented 94,957 infections, 46,179 outpatient
              visits, 1286 hospitalizations, and 15 deaths annually and had an
              incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $21,223/quality-adjusted

              model predicted that universal childhood hepatitis A vaccination
              led to significant reductions in hepatitis A mortality and
              morbidity. Consequently, universal vaccination was cost saving
              compared with a regional vaccination policy. Herd protection

              fecal immunochemical test (FIT). The aim of this study is to
              estimate whether the additional benefits of FIT screening
              compared to gFOBT outweigh the additional costs and harms.
              METHODS: We used microsimulation modeling to estimate quality
              adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and costs of gFOBT and FIT,
              compared to no screening, in a cohort of screening participants.
              We compared strategies with various age ranges, screening
              intervals, and cut-off levels for FIT. Cost-efficient strategies
              were determined for various levels of available colonoscopy
              capacity. RESULTS: Compared to no screening, biennial gFOBT
              screening between age 50-74 years provided 20 QALYs at a cost of
              CAN\$200,900 per 1,000 participants, and required 17
              colonoscopies per 1,000 participants per year. FIT screening was
              more effective and less costly. For the same level of colonoscopy
              requirement, biennial FIT (with a high cut-off level of 200 ng
              Hb/ml) between age 50-74 years provided 11 extra QALYs gained
              while saving CAN\$333,300 per 1000 participants, compared to
              gFOBT. Without restrictions in colonoscopy capacity, FIT (with a
              low cut-off level of 50 ng Hb/ml) every year between age 45-80
              years was the most cost-effective strategy providing 27 extra
              QALYs gained per 1000 participants, while saving CAN\$448,300.
              INTERPRETATION: Compared to gFOBT screening, switching to FIT at
              a high cut-off level could increase the health benefits of a CRC

              was sampled from The Health Improvement Network database, a large
              primary care database. A discrete-event simulation was used to
              model the process of inviting people for assessment, assessing
              cardiovascular risk, and initiation and persistence with drug
              treatment. Risk factors and drug cessation rates were obtained
              from primary care data. Published sources provided estimates of
              uptake of assessment, treatment initiation, and treatment
              effects. The researchers determined the lifetime costs and
              quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with opportunistic case
              finding, and strategies prioritising and targeting patients by
              age or prior estimate of cardiovascular risk. This study reports
              on the optimum strategy if a QALY is valued at \pounds{}20 000.
              RESULTS: Compared with no case finding, inviting all adults aged
              30-74 years in a population of 10 000 yields 30.32 QALYs at a
              total cost of \pounds{}705 732. The optimum strategy is to rank
              patients by prior risk estimate and invite 8\% of those who are
              assessed as being at highest risk (those at $\geq$12.76\%
              predicted 10-year CVD risk), yielding 17.53 QALYs at a cost of
              \pounds{}162 280. There is an 89.4\% probability that the optimum
              strategy is to invite <35\% of patients for assessment.
              CONCLUSION: Across all age ranges, targeted case finding using a
              prior estimate of CVD risk is more efficient than universal case
              finding in healthy adults.",

              develop an innovative model to assess the effectiveness, cost,
              and harms of risk stratified colorectal cancer screening.
              METHODS: We updated a previously validated microsimulation model
              consisting of three interlinked components: risk assessment,
              natural history, and screening/treatment modules. We used data
              from representative national surveys and the literature to create
              a synthetic population that mimics the family history and genetic
              profile of the US population. We applied risk stratification
              based on published risk assessment tools to triage individuals
              into five risk categories: high, increased, medium, decreased,
              and low. RESULTS: On average, the incremental cost of risk
              stratified screening for colorectal cancer compared to the
              current approach at 60\% and 80\% compliance rates is $18,342 and
              $23,961 per life year gained. The harms in terms of false
              positives and perforations are consistently lower for
              personalized scenarios across all compliance rates. False
              positives are reduced by more than 47.0\% and perforations by at
              least 9.9\%. There is considerable uncertainty in the life years
              gained, but the reduction in harms remains stable under all
              scenarios. CONCLUSION: A key finding is that risk stratified
              screening can reduce harms at all levels of compliance.
              Therefore, selection of screening scenarios should include
              comprehensive comparisons of mortality, harms from screening, and
              cost. This study provides guidance for evaluating risk stratified
              cancer screening and further research is required to identify
              optimal implementation approaches in the real-world setting.",

              cost effectiveness of (a) the NCSP strategy (annual screening
              offer to men and women aged under 25 years) and (b) alternative
              screening strategies. METHODS: A stochastic, individual based,
              dynamic sexual network model was combined with a cost
              effectiveness model to estimate the complications and associated
              costs of chlamydial infection. The model was constructed and
              parameterised from the perspective of the National Health Service
              (NHS) (England), including the direct costs of infection,
              complications and screening. Unit costs were derived from
              standard data sources and published studies. The average and
              incremental cost effectiveness ratio (cost per major outcome
              averted or quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained) of chlamydia
              screening strategies targeting women and/or men of different age
              groups was estimated. Sensitivity analyses were done to explore
              model uncertainty. RESULTS: All screening strategies modelled are
              likely to cost the NHS money and improve health. If pelvic
              inflammatory disease (PID) progression is less than 10\% then
              screening at any level is unlikely to be cost effective. However,
              if PID progression is 10\% or higher the NCSP strategy compared
              to no screening appears to be cost effective. The incremental
              cost effectiveness analysis suggests that screening men and women
              aged under 20 years is the most beneficial strategy that falls
              below accepted thresholds. There is a high degree of uncertainty
              in the findings. CONCLUSIONS: Offering an annual screening test
              to men and women aged under 20 years may be the most cost
              effective strategy (that is, under accepted thresholds) if PID

              night (e.g., from 11:00 pm to 7:30 am) face decisions on optimal
              operating room (OR) staffing. Emergency patients need to be
              operated on within a predefined safety window to decrease
              morbidity and improve their chances of full recovery. We
              developed a process to determine the optimal OR team composition
              during the night, such that staffing costs are minimized, while
              providing adequate resources to start surgery within the safety
              interval. METHODS: A discrete event simulation in combination
              with modeling of safety intervals was applied. Emergency surgery
              was allowed to be postponed safely. The model was tested using
              data from the main OR of Erasmus University Medical Center
              (Erasmus MC). Two outcome measures were calculated: violation of
              safety intervals and frequency with which OR and anesthesia
              nurses were called in from home. We used the following input data
              from Erasmus MC to estimate distributions of all relevant
              parameters in our model: arrival times of emergency patients,
              durations of surgical cases, length of stay in the postanesthesia
              care unit, and transportation times. In addition, surgeons and OR
              staff of Erasmus MC specified safety intervals. RESULTS: Reducing
              in-house team members from 9 to 5 increased the fraction of
              patients treated too late by 2.5\% as compared to the baseline
              scenario. Substantially more OR and anesthesia nurses were called
              in from home when needed. CONCLUSION: The use of safety intervals
              benefits OR management during nights. Modeling of safety
              intervals substantially influences the number of emergency
              patients treated on time. Our case study showed that by modeling
              safety intervals and applying computer simulation, an OR can

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Early childhood caries (ECC)--tooth decay among
              children younger than 6 years--is prevalent and consequential,
              affecting nearly half of US 5-year-olds, despite being highly
              preventable. Various interventions have been explored to limit
              caries activity leading to cavities, but little is known about
              the long-term effects and costs of these interventions. We
              developed a system dynamics model to determine which
              interventions, singly and in combination, could have the greatest
              effect in reducing caries experience and cost in a population of
              children aged birth to 5 years. METHODS: System dynamics is a
              computer simulation technique useful to policy makers in choosing
              the most appropriate interventions for their populations. This
              study of Colorado preschool children models 6 categories of ECC
              intervention--applying fluorides, limiting cariogenic bacterial
              transmission from mothers to children, using xylitol directly
              with children, clinical treatment, motivational interviewing, and
              combinations of these--to compare their relative effect and cost.
              RESULTS: The model projects 10-year intervention costs ranging
              from $6 million to $245 million and relative reductions in cavity
              prevalence ranging from none to 79.1\% from the baseline.
              Interventions targeting the youngest children take 2 to 4 years
              longer to affect the entire population of preschool-age children
              but ultimately exert a greater benefit in reducing ECC;
              interventions targeting the highest-risk children provide the
              greatest return on investment, and combined interventions that
              target ECC at several stages of its natural history have the
              greatest potential for cavity reduction. Some interventions save
              more in dental repair than their cost; all produce substantial
              reductions in repair cost. CONCLUSION: By using data relevant to
              any geographic area, this system model can provide policy makers
              with information to maximize the return on public health and

              insight into the sensitivity of the system to various physical

              various statistics about the modelled centre, including the
              throughput capacity, fraction times for different groups of
              patients and beam waiting times. A method of quantifying the

              against the MD Anderson Cancer Center showed good agreement
              between the modelled (140 $\pm$ 4 fractions per day) and reported
              (133 $\pm$ 35 fractions per day) throughputs. A sensitivity
              analysis of that system studied the impact of beam switch time,
              the number of treatment rooms, patient set-up times and the
              potential benefit of having a second accelerator. Finally,
              scenarios relevant to a potential UK facility were studied,
              finding that a centre with the same four-room, single-accelerator
              configuration as the MD Anderson Cancer Center but handling a
              more complex UK-type caseload would have a throughput reduced by
              approximately 19\%, but still be capable of treating in excess of

              crime reporting interventions to reduce community crime
              perpetrated by youth. METHOD: Agents within the model represent
              individual residents and interact on a two-dimensional grid
              representing an abstract nonempirically grounded community
              setting. Juvenile agents are assigned initial random
              probabilities of perpetrating a crime and adults are assigned
              random probabilities of witnessing and reporting crimes. The
              agents' behavioral probabilities modify depending on the
              individual's experience with criminal behavior and punishment,
              and exposure to community crime interventions. Cost-effectiveness
              analyses assessed the impact of activating different percentages
              of adults to increase reporting and reduce community crime
              activity. Community-wide interventions were compared with
              spatially focused interventions, in which activated adults were
              focused in areas of highest crime prevalence. RESULTS: The ABM
              suggests that both community-wide and spatially focused
              interventions can be effective in reducing overall offenses, but
              their relative effectiveness may depend on the intensity and cost
              of the interventions. Although spatially focused intervention
              yielded localized reductions in crimes, such interventions were
              shown to move crime to nearby communities. Community-wide
              interventions can achieve larger reductions in overall community
              crime offenses than spatially focused interventions, as long as
              sufficient resources are available. CONCLUSION: The ABM
              demonstrates that community-wide and spatially focused crime
              strategies produce unique intervention dynamics influencing
              juvenile crime behaviors through the decisions and actions of
              community adults. It shows how such models might be used to

              ratio of AUD 22,500 per disability-adjusted life year (DALY)
              averted, and metformin with a cost-effectiveness ratio of AUD
              21,500 per DALY averted. The incremental addition of one
              intervention to the other is not cost-effective.
              CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Screening for pre-diabetes followed
              by diet and exercise, or metformin treatment is cost-effective
              and should be considered for incorporation into current practice.
              The number of dietitians and exercise physiologists needed to
              deliver such lifestyle change interventions will need to be
              increased to appropriately support the intervention.",

              mitigation guidance that includes isolation and antiviral
              treatment of ill persons, voluntary household member quarantine

              school closure, reduction of contacts at work, and prioritized
              vaccination. Is this the best strategy combination? Is choice of
              this strategy robust to pandemic uncertainties? What are critical
              enablers of community resilience? METHODS AND FINDINGS: We
              systematically simulate a broad range of pandemic scenarios and
              mitigation strategies using a networked, agent-based model of a
              community of explicit, multiply-overlapping social contact
              networks. We evaluate illness and societal burden for alterations
              in social networks, illness parameters, or intervention
              implementation. For a 1918-like pandemic, the best strategy
              minimizes illness to <1\% of the population and combines
              network-based (e.g. school closure, social distancing of all with
              adults' contacts at work reduced), and case-based measures (e.g.
              antiviral treatment of the ill and prophylaxis of household
              members). We find choice of this best strategy robust to removal
              of enhanced transmission by the young, additional complexity in
              contact networks, and altered influenza natural history including
              extended viral shedding. Administration of age-group or randomly
              targeted 50\% effective pre-pandemic vaccine with 7\% population
              coverage (current US H5N1 vaccine stockpile) had minimal effect
              on outcomes. In order, mitigation success depends on rapid
              strategy implementation, high compliance, regional mitigation,
              and rigorous rescinding criteria; these are the critical enablers
              for community resilience. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic evaluation of
              feasible, recommended pandemic influenza interventions generally
              confirms the US community mitigation guidance yields best
              strategy choices for pandemic planning that are robust to a wide
              range of uncertainty. The best strategy combines network- and
              case-based interventions; network-based interventions are
              paramount. Because strategies must be applied rapidly,
              regionally, and stringently for greatest benefit, preparation and
              public education is required for long-lasting, high community

              papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 is being offered
              free-of-charge to one birth cohort of girls aged 11-14. Screening
              is opportunistic (annual/biannual) contributing to social and
              geographical disparities. METHODS: A multi-HPV-type
              microsimulation model was calibrated to epidemiologic data from
              Spain utilising likelihood-based methods to assess the health and
              economic impact of adding HPV vaccination to cervical cancer
              screening. Strategies included (1) screening alone of women over
              age 25, varying frequency (every 1-5 years) and test (cytology,
              HPV DNA testing); (2) HPV vaccination of 11-year-old girls
              combined with screening. Outcomes included lifetime cancer risk,
              life expectancy, lifetime costs, number of clinical procedures
              and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: After the
              introduction of HPV vaccination, screening will need to continue,
              and strategies that incorporated HPV testing are more effective
              and cost-effective than those with cytology alone. For vaccinated
              girls, 5-year organised cytology with HPV testing as triage from
              ages 30 to 65 costs 24,350€ per year of life saved (YLS),
              assuming life-long vaccine immunity against HPV-16/18 by 3 doses
              with 90\% coverage. Unvaccinated girls would benefit from
              organised cytology screening with HPV testing as triage; 5-year
              screening from ages 30 to 65 costs 16,060€/YLS and 4-year
              screening from ages 30 to 85 costs 38,250€/YLS. Interventions
              would be cost-effective depending on the cost-effectiveness
              threshold and the vaccine price. CONCLUSIONS: In Spain,
              inequitable coverage and overuse of cytology make screening
              programmes inefficient. If high vaccination coverage among
              pre-adolescent girls is achieved, organised cytology screening
              with HPV triage starting at ages 30 to at least 65 every 4-5

              US Veteran population to inform policy and practice. METHODS: A
              System Dynamics stroke model of the Veteran population was
              constructed to evaluate the relative impact of 15 intervention
              scenarios including both broad and targeted primary and secondary
              prevention and acute care/rehabilitation on cumulative (20 years)
              outcomes including quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained,
              strokes prevented, stroke fatalities prevented, and the
              number-needed-to-treat per QALY gained. RESULTS: At the
              population level, a broad hypertension control effort yielded the
              largest increase in QALYs (35,517), followed by targeted
              prevention addressing hypertension and anticoagulation among
              Veterans with prior cardiovascular disease (27,856) and
              hypertension control among diabetics (23,100). Adjusting QALYs
              gained by the number of Veterans needed to treat, thrombolytic
              therapy with tissue-type plasminogen activator was most
              efficient, needing 3.1 Veterans to be treated per QALY gained.
              This was followed by rehabilitation (3.9) and targeted prevention
              addressing hypertension and anticoagulation among those with
              prior cardiovascular disease (5.1). Probabilistic sensitivity
              analysis showed that the ranking of interventions was robust to
              uncertainty in input parameter values. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention
              strategies tend to have larger population impacts, though
              interventions targeting specific high-risk groups tend to be more

              cost-effectiveness studies of CRC prevention and control have not
              included these costs and therefore underestimate potential
              savings from CRC prevention and control. PURPOSE: To use
              microsimulation modeling study to estimate and project
              productivity costs of CRC and to model the savings from four
              approaches to reducing CRC incidence and mortality: risk factor
              reduction, improved screening, improved treatment, and a
              simultaneous approach where all three strategies are implemented.
              METHODS: A model was developed to project productivity losses
              from CRC using the U.S. population with CRC incidence and
              mortality projected through the year 2020. Outcome measures were
              CRC mortality, morbidity, and productivity savings. RESULTS: With
              2005 levels in risk factors, screening, and treatment, 48,748 CRC
              deaths occurred in 2010, amounting to $21 billion of lost
              productivity. Using prevention and treatment strategies
              simultaneously, 3586 deaths could have been avoided in 2010,
              leading to a savings of $1.4 billion. Cumulatively, by 2020,
              simultaneous strategies that reduce risk factors and increase
              screening and treatment could result in 101,353 deaths avoided
              and $33.9 billion in savings in reduced productivity loss.
              Improved screening rates alone led to nearly $14.7 billion in
              savings between 2005 and 2020, followed by risk factor reduction
              ($12.4 billion) and improved treatment ($8.4 billion).
              CONCLUSIONS: The savings in productivity loss from strategies to
              reduce CRC incidence and mortality are substantial, providing

  abstract = "CONTEXT: During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, computational agent-based
              models (ABMs) were extensively used to evaluate interventions to
              control the spread of emerging pathogens. However, evaluating
              different possible combinations of interventions using ABMs can
              be computationally very expensive and time-consuming. Therefore,
              most policy studies have examined the impact of a single policy
              decision. OBJECTIVE: To apply a sequential experimental design
              method with an ABM to analyze policy alternatives composed of a
              combination of school closure and vaccination policies to provide
              a set of promising ``optimal'' combinations of policies to
              control an H1N1-type epidemic to policy makers. METHODS: We used
              an open-source agent-based modeling system, FRED (A Framework for
              Reconstructing Epidemiological Dynamic), to simulate the spread
              of an H1N1 epidemic in Alleghany County, Pennsylvania, with a
              census-based synthetic population. We used an approach called
              best subset selection method to evaluate 72 alternative policies
              consisting of a combination of options for school closure
              threshold, closure duration, Advisory Committee on Immunization
              Practices prioritization, and second-dose vaccination
              prioritization policies. Using the attack rate as a performance
              measure, best subset selection enabled us to eliminate inferior
              alternatives and identify a small group of alternative policies
              that could be further evaluated on the basis of other criteria.
              RESULTS: Our sequential design approach to evaluate a combination
              of alternative mitigation policies leads to a savings in
              computational effort by a factor of 2 when examining combinations
              of school closure and vaccination policies. CONCLUSIONS: Best
              subset selection demonstrates a substantial reduction in the
              computational burden of a large-scale ABM in evaluating several
              alternative policies. Our method also provides policy makers with
              a set of promising policy combinations for further evaluation

  abstract = "PRINCIPLES: Current evidence indicates that chronic kidney
              disease (CKD) can be detected by simple laboratory tests. This
              study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of
              microalbuminuria screening and subsequent treatment in different
              populations. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness of microalbuminuria
              screening in a cohort of simulated subjects aged $\geq$50 years
              was assessed using a validated microsimulation model.
              Microalbuminuria screening was simulated for 1-, 2-, 5- or
              10-year intervals and for 3 groups: diabetes (DM), hypertension
              but no diabetes (HTN), and no diabetes or hypertension. Positive
              microalbuminuria screening was followed by treatment with
              angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II
              receptor blockers (ARBs). The model outcomes evaluate costs from
              a health care system perspective. RESULTS: Screening of risk
              groups is cost-effective at a 2-year interval for the DM group
              with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 54,000
              CHF/ Quality-Adjusted-Life-Years (QALY) and at a 5-year interval
              for the HTN group with an ICER of 33,000 CHF/QALY. Screening of
              the remaining population is cost-effective at a 10-year interval
              with an ICER of 34,000 CHF/QALY. The ICER improves with longer
              screening intervals for all groups. A probabilistic sensitivity
              analysis (PSA) confirmed 2-year, 5-year and 10-year intervals as
              the most cost-effective for the DM group, the HTN group and the
              remaining population respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Microalbuminuria
              screening can be considered cost-effective starting at the age of
              50 years at bi-annual intervals for subjects with diabetes, at
              5-year intervals for subjects with hypertension and at 10-year
              intervals for the remaining population. Our results indicate that
              early detection and treatment of CKD might lead to optimised
              patient care, and offer guidance for future implementation of CKD

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To determine the most cost-effective screening
              programme for cervical cancer. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness
              analysis from a societal perspective. SETTING: The Netherlands.
              POPULATION: Dutch women who have not been invited for human
              papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. METHODS: We calibrated the
              microsimulation screening analysis (MISCAN) model to Dutch
              epidemiological data. We used this model to consider nine
              screening strategies that use: (i) cytological testing with
              cytology triage for borderline/mildly abnormal smears; (ii) HPV
              testing with cytology triage for HPV-positive smears; or (iii)
              cytological testing with HPV triage for borderline/mildly
              abnormal smears. For each strategy, we varied the number of
              screening rounds, the time interval, the age of the first
              screening, and the type of cytological testing (conventional or
              liquid-based cytology). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted
              life years (QALYs) gained and costs from a societal perspective.
              RESULTS: Under the base-case assumptions, primary HPV testing
              with cytology triage is the most cost-effective strategy. Using
              cost-effectiveness thresholds of € 20,000 and € 50,000 per QALY
              gained yields optimal screening programmes with three and seven
              screening rounds, respectively. The results are sensitive to
              several uncertain model inputs, most importantly the costs of the
              HPV test. For women aged 32 years or younger, primary cytology
              screening is more cost-effective than primary HPV testing.
              CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the interval between screening rounds and
              changing the primary test from cytology to HPV testing can
              improve the effectiveness and decrease the costs of cervical
              cancer screening in the Netherlands.",

              prediction models; and (ii) development of models to determine
              optimal surveillance pathways. DESIGN: A discrete event
              simulation economic modelling evaluation. Data from systematic
              reviews of risk prediction models and agreement between
              tonometers, secondary analyses of existing datasets (to validate

              and public preferences were used to structure and populate the
              economic model. SETTING: Primary and secondary care.
              PARTICIPANTS: Adults with ocular hypertension (IOP > 21 mmHg) and
              the public (surveillance preferences). INTERVENTIONS: We compared
              five pathways: two based on National Institute for Health and
              Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines with monitoring interval
              and treatment depending on initial risk stratification, 'NICE
              intensive' (4-monthly to annual monitoring) and 'NICE
              conservative' (6-monthly to biennial monitoring); two pathways,
              differing in location (hospital and community), with monitoring
              biennially and treatment initiated for a $\geq$ 6\% 5-year
              glaucoma risk; and a 'treat all' pathway involving treatment with
              a prostaglandin analogue if IOP > 21 mmHg and IOP measured
              annually in the community. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Glaucoma cases
              detected; tonometer agreement; public preferences; costs;
              willingness to pay and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).
              RESULTS: The best available glaucoma risk prediction model
              estimated the 5-year risk based on age and ocular predictors
              (IOP, central corneal thickness, optic nerve damage and index of
              visual field status). Taking the average of two IOP readings, by
              tonometry, true change was detected at two years. Sizeable
              measurement variability was noted between tonometers. There was a
              general public preference for monitoring; good communication and
              understanding of the process predicted service value. 'Treat all'
              was the least costly and 'NICE intensive' the most costly
              pathway. Biennial monitoring reduced the number of cases of
              glaucoma conversion compared with a 'treat all' pathway and
              provided more QALYs, but the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio
              (ICER) was considerably more than \pounds{}30,000. The 'NICE
              intensive' pathway also avoided glaucoma conversion, but
              NICE-based pathways were either dominated (more costly and less
              effective) by biennial hospital monitoring or had a ICERs >
              \pounds{}30,000. Results were not sensitive to the risk threshold
              for initiating surveillance but were sensitive to the risk
              threshold for initiating treatment, NHS costs and treatment
              adherence. LIMITATIONS: Optimal monitoring intervals were based
              on IOP data. There were insufficient data to determine the
              optimal frequency of measurement of the visual field or optic
              nerve head for identification of glaucoma. The economic modelling
              took a 20-year time horizon which may be insufficient to capture
              long-term benefits. Sensitivity analyses may not fully capture
              the uncertainty surrounding parameter estimates. CONCLUSIONS: For
              confirmed ocular hypertension, findings suggest that there is no
              clear benefit from intensive monitoring. Consideration of the
              patient experience is important. A cohort study is recommended to
              provide data to refine the glaucoma risk prediction model,
              determine the optimum type and frequency of serial glaucoma tests
              and estimate costs and patient preferences for monitoring and

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Various centralised mammography screening programmes
              have shown to reduce breast cancer mortality at reasonable costs.
              However, mammography screening is not necessarily cost-effective
              in every situation. Opportunistic screening, the predominant
              screening modality in several European countries, may under
              certain circumstances be a cost-effective alternative. In this
              study, we compared the cost-effectiveness of both screening
              modalities in Switzerland. METHODS: Using micro-simulation
              modelling, we predicted the effects and costs of biennial
              mammography screening for 50-69 years old women between 1999 and
              2020, in the Swiss female population aged 30-70 in 1999. A
              sensitivity analysis on the test sensitivity of opportunistic
              screening was performed. RESULTS: Organised mammography screening
              with an 80\% participation rate yielded a breast cancer mortality
              reduction of 13\%. Twenty years after the start of screening, the
              predicted annual breast cancer mortality was 25\% lower than in a
              situation without screening. The 3\% discounted
              cost-effectiveness ratio of organised mammography screening was
              euro11,512 per life year gained. Opportunistic screening with a
              similar participation rate was comparably effective, but at twice
              the costs: euro22,671-24,707 per life year gained. This was
              mainly related to the high costs of opportunistic mammography and
              frequent use of imaging diagnostics in combination with an
              opportunistic mammogram. CONCLUSION: Although data on the
              performance of opportunistic screening are limited, both
              opportunistic and organised mammography screening seem effective
              in reducing breast cancer mortality in Switzerland. However, for
              opportunistic screening to become equally cost-effective as
              organised screening, costs and use of additional diagnostics
              should be reduced.",

              short supply. PURPOSE: This article aims to determine the effects
              of varying vaccine coverage, compliance, administration rates,
              prioritization, and timing among employees during an influenza
              pandemic. METHODS: As part of the H1N1 influenza planning efforts
              of the Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study network, an
              agent-based computer simulation model was developed for the
              Washington DC metropolitan region, encompassing five metropolitan
              statistical areas. Each simulation run involved introducing 100
              infectious individuals to initiate a 1.3 reproductive-rate (R(0))
              epidemic, consistent with H1N1 parameters to date. Another set of
              scenarios represented a R(0)=1.6 epidemic. RESULTS: An
              unmitigated epidemic resulted in substantial productivity losses
              (a mean of $112.6 million for a serologic 15\% attack rate and
              $193.8 million for a serologic 25\% attack rate), even with the
              relatively low estimated mortality impact of H1N1. Although
              vaccinating Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices-defined
              priority groups resulted in the largest savings, vaccinating all
              remaining workers captured additional savings and, in fact,
              reduced healthcare workers' and critical infrastructure workers'
              chances of infection. Moreover, although employee vaccination
              compliance affected the epidemic, once 20\% compliance was
              achieved, additional increases in compliance provided less
              incremental benefit. Even though a vast majority of the
              workplaces in the DC metropolitan region had fewer than 100
              employees, focusing on vaccinating only those in larger firms (>
              or =100 employees) was just as effective in mitigating the
              epidemic as trying to vaccinate employees in all workplaces.
              CONCLUSIONS: Timely vaccination of at least 20\% of the
              large-company workforce can play an important role in epidemic

              A modeling study was conducted to project screening effects for
              various screening strategies into the future. METHODS AND
              FINDINGS: We used a stochastic network simulation model
              incorporating partnership formation and dissolution, aging and a
              sexual life course perspective. Trends in baseline rates of
              chlamydia testing and treatment were used to describe the
              epidemiological situation before the start of the screening
              program. Data on participation rates was used to describe
              screening uptake in rural and urban areas. Simulations were used
              to project the effectiveness of screening on chlamydia prevalence
              for a time period of 10 years. In addition, we tested alternative
              screening strategies, such as including only women, targeting
              different age groups, and biennial screening. Screening reduced
              prevalence by about 1\% in the first two screening rounds and
              leveled off after that. Extrapolating observed participation
              rates into the future indicated very low participation in the
              long run. Alternative strategies only marginally changed the
              effectiveness of screening. Higher participation rates as
              originally foreseen in the program would have succeeded in
              reducing chlamydia prevalence to very low levels in the long run.
              CONCLUSIONS: Decreasing participation rates over time profoundly
              impact the effectiveness of population based screening for
              chlamydia infections. Using data from several consecutive rounds
              of screening in a simulation model enabled us to assess the
              future effectiveness of screening on prevalence. If participation
              rates cannot be kept at a sufficient level, the effectiveness of
              screening on prevalence will remain limited.",

              nation-wide coverage since 2005. All women aged 50-69 years are
              invited biennially for mammography screening. We evaluated breast
              cancer mortality reduction and performed a cost-effectiveness
              analysis, using our microsimulation model, calibrated to most
              recent data. The microsimulation model allows for the comparison
              of mortality and costs between a (hypothetical) situation without
              screening and a situation with screening. Breast cancer incidence
              in Norway had a steep increase in the early 1990s. We calibrated
              the model to simulate this increase and included recent costs for
              screening, diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer and travel
              and productivity loss. We estimate a 16\% breast cancer mortality
              reduction for a cohort of women, invited to screening, followed
              over their complete lifetime. Cost-effectiveness is estimated at
              NOK 112,162 per QALY gained, when taking only direct medical
              costs into account (the cost of the buses, examinations, and
              invitations). We used a 3.5\% annual discount rate.
              Cost-effectiveness estimates are substantially below the
              threshold of NOK 1,926,366 as recommended by the WHO guidelines.
              For the Norwegian population, which has been gradually exposed to
              screening, breast cancer mortality reduction for women exposed to
              screening is increasing and is estimated to rise to ∼30\% in 2020
              for women aged 55-80 years. The NBCSP is a highly cost-effective
              measure to reduce breast cancer specific mortality. We estimate a
              breast cancer specific mortality reduction of 16-30\%, at the

              it is necessary not only to treat more patients, but to deliver
              treatment as early as possible. The aims of our study were to
              prospectively evaluate the clinical benefit from reducing delays
              in the emergency stroke pathway at our district hospital and
              examine outcomes from scenarios that include extension of the
              alteplase license. METHODS: We developed a discrete-event
              simulation from prospective data for patients with stroke
              arriving at our large district hospital. We modeled current
              practice and assessed the impact on stroke outcomes of measures
              to reduce in-hospital delays to alteplase treatment and of
              extensions to the European license for alteplase from 3 to 4.5
              hours and to people aged >80 years. RESULTS: Extension of the
              time window to 4.5 hours increases the thrombolysis rate by 4\%,
              yielding an additional 2 patients per year with minimal or no
              disability at 3 months. Time window extension is most effective
              when combined with a system of prealerts, achieving a
              thrombolysis rate of 15\% and an additional 8 patients per year
              with minimal or no disability, increasing to 13 patients per year
              with extension of the license to patients >80 years. CONCLUSIONS:
              If implemented alone, extension of the time window for alteplase
              has only a modest additional population disability benefit, but
              this benefit can be increased 5-fold if time window extension is
              combined with substantial reductions to in-hospital delays.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To determine if a mass influenza/pneumococcal
              vaccination clinic could vaccinate 15,000 clients in 17 h;
              optimize personnel configuration to maximize number of clients
              vaccinated; and estimate costs (opportunity and clinic) and
              revenue. METHOD: The author used a discrete event simulation
              model to estimate the throughput of the vaccination clinic as the
              number of clients (arrival intensity) increased and as staff
              members were reassigned to different workflows. We represented
              workflows for 3 client types: ``Medicare,'' ''Special,'' and
              ``Cash,'' where ''Special'' designates Medicare clients who
              needed assistance moving through the clinic. The costs of
              supplies, staff sal-aries, and client waiting time were included
              in the model. We compared the ``original'' model based on the
              staffing and performance of an actual clinic to an ;;optimized''
              model in which staff were reassigned to optimize number of
              clients vaccinated. RESULTS: A maximum of 13,138 and 15,094
              clients in the original and optimized models, respectively, were
              vaccinated. At the original arrival rate (8300 clients vaccinated
              in 17 h), supplies cost about \$191,000 and were the most
              expensive component of the clinic operation in both models.
              However, as the arrival intensity increased to 140\%, the
              ''Medicare'' client opportunity cost increased from \$23,887 and
              \$21,474 to \$743,510 and \$740,760 for the simulated original
              and optimized models, respectively. CONCLUSION: The clinic could
              reach their target of 15,000 vaccinees with 2 fewer staff members
              by rearranging staff assignments from ``Special'' to ``Medicare''

              1-2 years for women older than 40 years; more than 70\% of women
              now participate in routine screening. No studies have examined
              the societal impact of screening practices over the past decade
              in the United States on costs and quality-adjusted life-years
              (QALYs). We performed a retrospective cost-effectiveness analysis
              comparing actual and alternative screening mammography scenarios.
              METHODS: We used a discrete-event simulation model of breast
              cancer epidemiology to estimate the costs and the number of QALYs
              that were associated with observed screening mammography patterns
              in the United States from 1990 to 2000 for women aged 40 years or
              older. We also estimated costs and QALYS for no screening and for
              64 alternative screening scenarios. Incremental
              cost-effectiveness ratios were computed. Sensitivity analyses
              were performed on key parameters. RESULTS: Actual U.S. screening
              patterns from 1990 to 2000 accrued 947.5 million QALYs and cost
              $166 billion over the lifetimes of the screened women, resulting
              in a gain of 1.7 million QALYs for an additional cost of $62.5
              billion compared with no screening. Among those polices that were
              not dominated--i.e., for which no alternative existed that
              produced more QALYs for lower costs--screening all women aged
              40-80 years annually per some U.S. guidelines was the most
              expensive option, costing $58,000 per additional QALY gained
              compared with the next most costly alternative, screening all
              women aged 45-80 years annually. Many alternative screening
              scenarios generated more QALYs for less cost (with savings up to
              $6 billion) than actual screening patterns over the study period.
              Sensitivity analysis showed that conclusions about the
              cost-effectiveness of screening mammography policies were highly
              sensitive to small, short-term detrimental effects on quality of
              life from the screening test itself. CONCLUSIONS: Choosing among
              the efficient policies to guide current screening recommendations
              requires consideration of costs to promote participation in

              self-insure. METHODOLOGY: The model considers the risk that the
              firm bears when self-insuring and the opportunity to mitigate
              that risk by purchasing stop-loss insurance. The model makes use
              of a structural, utility maximization framework to account for
              numerous aspects of the firm decision, and a multinomial probit
              to reproduce the elasticity of the firm's demand for health
              insurance. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our simulations provide
              three important conclusions. First, they project significant
              increases in self-insurance rates among small firms--presumably
              induced by the desire to avoid ACA's rate-banding and risk
              adjustment regulations-only if generous stop-loss policies become
              widely available. Second, they show that this increase would be
              due to this hypothetical adoption of widespread, generous
              reinsurance by the market and not by passage of the ACA. Third,
              even with a substantial increase of self-insurance rates among
              small firms, they project negligible adverse selection in the
              exchanges, as indicated by our finding that the increase in
              exchange premium is less than 0.5\% when assuming very generous
              stop-loss policies after implementation of the ACA.",

              2015. OBJECTIVE: To estimate financial implications of CCM
              payment for primary care practices. DESIGN: Microsimulation model
              incorporating national data on primary care use, staffing,
              expenditures, and reimbursements. DATA SOURCES: National
              Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and other published sources.
              TARGET POPULATION: Medicare patients. TIME HORIZON: 10 years.
              PERSPECTIVE: Practice-level. INTERVENTION: Comparison of CCM
              delivery approaches by staff and physicians. OUTCOME MEASURES:
              Net revenue per full-time equivalent (FTE) physician; time spent
              delivering CCM services. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: If
              nonphysician staff were to deliver CCM services, net revenue to
              practices would increase despite opportunity and staffing costs.
              Practices could expect approximately $332 per enrolled patient
              per year (95\% CI, $234 to $429) if CCM services were delivered
              by registered nurses (RNs), approximately $372 (CI, $276 to $468)
              if services were delivered by licensed practical nurses, and
              approximately $385 (CI, $286 to $485) if services were delivered
              by medical assistants. For a typical practice, this equates to
              more than $75 ,00 of net annual revenue per FTE physician and 12
              hours of nursing service time per week if 50\% of eligible
              patients enroll. At a minimum, 131 Medicare patients (CI, 115 to
              140 patients) must enroll for practices to recoup the salary and
              overhead costs of hiring a full-time RN to provide CCM services.
              RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: If physicians were to deliver
              all CCM services, approximately 25\% of practices nationwide
              could expect net revenue losses due to opportunity costs of
              face-to-face visit time. LIMITATION: The CCM program may alter
              long-term primary care use, which is difficult to predict.
              CONCLUSION: Practices that rely on nonphysician team members to
              deliver CCM services will probably experience substantial net
              revenue gains but must enroll a sufficient number of eligible
              patients to recoup costs. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: None.",

              breast cancer are often screened with mammography before age 50
              years. Additional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) improves
              sensitivity and is cost-effective for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.
              However, for women with a family history without a proven
              mutation, cost-effectiveness is unclear. METHODS: We evaluated
              data of the largest prospective MRI screening study (MRISC).
              Between 1999 and 2007, 1597 women (8370 woman-years at risk) aged
              25 to 70 years with an estimated cumulative lifetime risk of 15\%
              to 50\% for breast cancer were screened with clinical breast
              examination every 6 months and with annual mammography and MRI.
              We calculated the cost per detected and treated breast cancer.
              After incorporating MRISC data into a microsimulation screening
              analysis model (MISCAN), different schemes were evaluated, and
              cost per life-year gained (LYG) was estimated in comparison with
              the Dutch nationwide breast cancer screening program (biennial
              mammography from age 50 to 75 years). All statistical tests were
              two-sided. RESULTS: Forty-seven breast cancers (9 ductal
              carcinoma in situ) were detected. Screening with additional MRI
              costs \$123 672 (€93 639) per detected breast cancer. In
              increasing age-cohorts, costs per detected and treated breast
              cancer decreased, but, unexpectedly, the percentage of MRI-only
              detected cancers increased. Screening under the MRISC-scheme from
              age 35 to 50 years was estimated to reduce breast cancer
              mortality by 25\% at \$134 932 (€102 164) per LYG (3.5\%
              discounting) compared with 17\% mortality reduction at \$54 665
              (€41 390) per LYG with mammography only. CONCLUSIONS: Screening

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Between diagnosis and primary treatment of patients
              with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), gaps of several weeks
              exist. Reducing these time intervals may benefit the patient and
              may lead to a reduction of costs. We explored the
              cost-effectiveness of early-initiated treatment of patients with
              suspected advanced-stage EOC compared with that of current
              treatment. METHODS: A discrete event simulation was used to
              synthesize all available evidences and to evaluate the health
              care costs and effects (quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) of
              the 2 treatment strategies over lifetime. Overall survival,
              progression-free survival, health-related quality of life, and
              costs of the separate events were assumed to remain equal. Other
              uncertainties were addressed using deterministic and
              probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The treatment times
              of current and early-initiated treatment were 27 and 24 weeks,
              respectively. Early-initiated treatment yielded 3.42 QALYs per
              patient, for a total expected health care cost of €25,654.
              Current treatment yielded 3.40 QALYs per patient, for a total
              expected health care cost of €25,607. This resulted in an
              incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €2592 per QALY gained for
              early-initiated treatment compared with that for current
              treatment. For the willingness to pay for €30,000 or more per
              QALY, early-initiated treatment had a 100\% probability of being
              cost-effective compared with current treatment under the
              previously mentioned assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: Given the current
              evidence, early-initiated treatment of patients with suspected
              advanced-stage EOC leads to additional QALYs and seems to be
              cost-effective compared with current treatment.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Most existing models of smoking cessation treatments
              have considered a single quit attempt when modelling long-term
              outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To develop a model to simulate smokers over
              their lifetimes accounting for multiple quit attempts and
              relapses which will allow for prediction of the long-term health
              and economic impact of smoking cessation strategies. METHODS: A
              discrete event simulation (DES) that models individuals' life
              course of smoking behaviours, attempts to quit, and the
              cumulative impact on health and economic outcomes was developed.
              Each individual is assigned one of the available strategies used
              to support each quit attempt; the outcome of each attempt, time
              to relapses if abstinence is achieved, and time between quit
              attempts is tracked. Based on each individual's smoking or
              abstinence patterns, the risk of developing diseases associated
              with smoking (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer,
              myocardial infarction and stroke) is determined and the
              corresponding costs, changes to mortality, and quality of life
              assigned. Direct costs are assessed from the perspective of a
              comprehensive US healthcare payer (\$US, 2012 values). Quit
              attempt strategies that can be evaluated in the current
              simulation include unassisted quit attempts, brief counselling,
              behavioural modification therapy, nicotine replacement therapy,
              bupropion, and varenicline, with the selection of strategies and
              time between quit attempts based on equations derived from survey
              data. Equations predicting the success of quit attempts as well
              as the short-term probability of relapse were derived from five
              varenicline clinical trials. RESULTS: Concordance between the
              five trials and predictions from the simulation on abstinence at
              12 months was high, indicating that the equations predicting
              success and relapse in the first year following a quit attempt
              were reliable. Predictions allowing for only a single quit
              attempt versus unrestricted attempts demonstrate important
              differences, with the single quit attempt simulation predicting
              19 \% more smoking-related diseases and 10 \% higher costs
              associated with smoking-related diseases. Differences are most
              prominent in predictions of the time that individuals abstain
              from smoking: 13.2 years on average over a lifetime allowing for
              multiple quit attempts, versus only 1.2 years with single quit
              attempts. Differences in abstinence time estimates become
              substantial only 5 years into the simulation. In the multiple
              quit attempt simulations, younger individuals survived longer,
              yet had lower lifetime smoking-related disease and total costs,
              while the opposite was true for those with high levels of
              nicotine dependence. CONCLUSION: By allowing for multiple quit
              attempts over the course of individuals' lives, the simulation
              can provide more reliable estimates on the health and economic
              impact of interventions designed to increase abstinence from
              smoking. Furthermore, the individual nature of the simulation
              allows for evaluation of outcomes in populations with different
              baseline profiles. DES provides a framework for comprehensive and
              appropriate predictions when applied to smoking cessation over
              smoker lifetimes.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Given the scale of the current obesity epidemic and
              associated health consequences there has been increasing concern
              about the economic burden placed on society in terms of direct
              healthcare costs and indirect societal costs. In the Republic of
              Ireland these costs were estimated at €1.13 billion for 2009. The
              total direct healthcare costs for six major obesity related
              conditions (coronary heart disease \& stroke, cancer,
              hypertension, type 2 diabetes and knee osteoarthritis) in the
              same year were estimated at €2.55 billion. The aim of this
              research is to project disease burden and direct healthcare costs
              for these conditions in Ireland to 2030 using the established
              model developed by the Health Forum (UK) for the Foresight:
              Tackling Obesities project. METHODOLOGY: Routine data sources
              were used to derive incidence, prevalence, mortality and survival
              for six conditions as inputs for the model. The model utilises a
              two stage modelling process to predict future BMI rates, disease
              prevalence and costs. Stage 1 employs a non-linear multivariate
              regression model to project BMI trends; stage 2 employs a
              microsimulation approach to produce longitudinal projections and
              test the impact of interventions upon future incidence of
              obesity-related disease. RESULTS: Overweight and obesity are
              projected to reach levels of 89\% and 85\% in males and females
              respectively by 2030. This will result in an increase in the
              obesity related prevalence of CHD \& stroke by 97\%, cancers by
              61\% and type 2 diabetes by 21\%. The direct healthcare costs
              associated with these increases will amount to €5.4 billion by
              2030. A 5\% reduction in population BMI levels by 2030 is
              projected to result in €495 million less being spent in
              obesity-related direct healthcare costs over twenty years.

              colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in the United States to
              80\% by 2018; it is unknown whether there is sufficient
              colonoscopy capacity to reach this goal. This study estimated the
              number of colonoscopies needed to screen 80\% of the eligible
              population with fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) or colonoscopy
              and determined whether there was sufficient colonoscopy capacity
              to meet the need. METHODS: The Microsimulation Screening
              Analysis-Colon model was used to simulate CRC screening test use
              in the United States (2014-2040); the implementation of a
              national screening program in 2014 with FIT or colonoscopy with
              80\% participation was assumed. The 2012 Survey of Endoscopic
              Capacity (SECAP) estimated the number of colonoscopies that were
              performed and the number that could be performed. RESULTS: If a
              national screening program started in 2014, by 2024,
              approximately 47 million FIT procedures and 5.1 million
              colonoscopies would be needed annually to screen the eligible
              population with a program using FIT as the primary screening
              test; approximately 11 to 13 million colonoscopies would be
              needed annually to screen the eligible population with a
              colonoscopy-only screening program. According to the SECAP
              survey, an estimated 15 million colonoscopies were performed in
              2012, and an additional 10.5 million colonoscopies could be
              performed. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated colonoscopy capacity is
              sufficient to screen 80\% of the eligible US population with FIT,
              colonoscopy, or a mix of tests. Future analyses should take into

              In unscreened persons with severe comorbid conditions, screening
              was cost-effective up to age 80 years (colonoscopy indicated up
              to age 77 years, sigmoidoscopy at age 78 years, and FIT at ages

              burden. Given the high direct medical costs associated with the
              disease, prevention of new transmission is an important element
              in limiting economic burden. In addition to providing therapeutic
              benefit, treatment with HAART has potential to prevent
              transmission of HIV. The objective in this study was to perform
              an economic evaluation of the incremental net benefit associated
              with an intervention to expand treatment with HAART in British
              Columbia, Canada. DESIGN: A mathematical model describing
              transmission of HIV, integrated with a microsimulation model
              describing the clinical and economic course of HIV. METHODS: The
              primary outcome was the incremental net benefit of expanding
              treatment with HAART from 50 to 75\% of clinically eligible
              individuals in British Columbia, assuming a willingness-to-pay
              threshold of US\$ 50,000 per quality-adjusted life year. Direct
              medical costs included were antiretroviral and nonantiretroviral
              medications, hospitalizations, physician visits, and laboratory
              tests. The mathematical and microsimulation models were based on
              patient characteristics observed in British Columbia.
              Longitudinal data described health services utilization, clinical
              progression, and survival for all individuals receiving treatment
              for HIV in British Columbia. RESULTS: Over 30 years, the HAART
              expansion scenario was associated with a net benefit of US\$ 900
              million (95\% confidence interval US\$ 493 million to 1.45

              to 75\% of clinically eligible individuals in British Columbia
              appears to be a cost-effective strategy based on this model.
              These cost-effectiveness results are consistent with public

              simulations of increasing the number of ED beds, increasing the

              potential effects on overall ED length of stay. Multiple
              sensitivity analyses tested the robustness of the results to
              changes in model assumptions and institutional data. RESULTS:
              With a constant ED departure rate at the base case and increasing
              ED beds, there is an increase in mean length of stay from 240 to
              247 minutes (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.8 to 12.6 minutes).
              When keeping the number of beds constant at the base case and
              increasing the rate at which admitted patients depart the ED to

              cost-effectiveness of alternative screening strategies involving
              MRI. METHODS: Using a microsimulation model, we generated life
              histories under different risk profiles, and assessed the impact
              of screening on quality-adjusted life-years, and lifetime costs,
              both discounted at 3\%. We compared 12 screening strategies
              combining annual or biennial MRI with mammography and clinical
              breast examination (CBE) in intervals of 0.5, 1, or 2 years vs
              without, and reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratios
              (ICERs). RESULTS: Based on an ICER threshold of $100,000/QALY,
              the most cost-effective strategy for women at 25\% lifetime risk
              was to stagger MRI and mammography plus CBE every year from age
              30 to 74, yielding ICER $58,400 (compared to biennial MRI alone).
              At 50\% lifetime risk and with 70\% reduction in MRI cost, the
              recommended strategy was to stagger MRI and mammography plus CBE
              every 6 months (ICER=$84,400). At 75\% lifetime risk, the
              recommended strategy is biennial MRI combined with mammography
              plus CBE every 6 months (ICER=$62,800). CONCLUSIONS: The high

              of death in Europe putting an unsustainable burden on already
              struggling health systems. Increases in obesity are a major cause
              of NCDs. This paper projects the future burden of coronary heart
              disease (CHD), stroke, type 2 diabetes and seven cancers by 2030
              in 53 WHO European Region countries based on current and past
              body mass index (BMI) trends. It also tests the impact of obesity
              interventions on the future disease burden. SETTING AND
              PARTICIPANTS: Secondary data analysis of country-specific
              epidemiological data using a microsimulation modelling process.
              INTERVENTIONS: The effect of three hypothetical scenarios on the
              future burden of disease in 2030 was tested: baseline scenario,
              BMI trends go unchecked; intervention 1, population BMI decreases
              by 1\%; intervention 2, BMI decreases by 5\%. PRIMARY AND
              SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Quantifying the future burden of
              major NCDs and the impact of interventions on this future disease
              burden. RESULTS: By 2030 in the whole of the European region, the
              prevalence of diabetes, CHD and stroke and cancers was projected
              to reach an average of 3990, 4672 and 2046 cases/100 000,
              respectively. The highest prevalence of diabetes was predicted in
              Slovakia (10 870), CHD and stroke-in Greece (11 292) and
              cancers-in Finland (5615 cases/100 000). A 5\% fall in population
              BMI was projected to significantly reduce cumulative incidence of
              diseases. The largest reduction in diabetes and CHD and stroke
              was observed in Slovakia (3054 and 3369 cases/100 000,
              respectively), and in cancers was predicted in Germany (331/100
              000). CONCLUSIONS: Modelling future disease trends is a useful
              tool for policymakers so that they can allocate resources
              effectively and implement policies to prevent NCDs. Future
              research will allow real policy interventions to be tested;

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes
              mellitus (T2DM) follows a stepwise progression. As a treatment
              loses its effectiveness, it is typically replaced with a more
              complex and frequently more costly treatment. Eventually this
              progression leads to the use of basal insulin typically with
              concomitant treatments (e.g., metformin, a GLP-1 RA
              [glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist], a TZD
              [thiazolidinedione] or a DPP-4i [dipeptidyl peptidase 4
              inhibitor]) and, ultimately, to basal-bolus insulin in some
              forms. As the cost of oral antidiabetics (OADs) and noninsulin
              injectables have approached, and in some cases exceeded, the cost
              of insulin, we reexamined the placement of insulin in T2DM
              treatment progression. Our hypothesis was that earlier use of
              insulin produces clinical and cost benefits due to its superior
              efficacy and treatment scalability at an acceptable cost when
              considered over a 5-year period. OBJECTIVES: To (a) estimate
              clinical and payer cost outcomes of initiating insulin treatment
              for patients with T2DM earlier in their treatment progression and
              (b) estimate clinical and payer cost outcomes resulting from
              delays in escalating treatment for T2DM when indicated by patient
              hemoglobin A1c levels. METHODS: We developed a Monte Carlo
              microsimulation model to estimate patients reaching target A1c,
              diabetes-related complications, mortality, and associated costs
              under various treatment strategies for newly diagnosed patients
              with T2DM. Treatment efficacies were modeled from results of
              randomized clinical trials, including the time and rate of A1c
              drift. A typical treatment progression was selected based on the
              American Diabetes Association and the European Association for
              the Study of Diabetes guidelines as the standard of care (SOC).
              Two treatment approaches were evaluated: two-stage insulin (basal
              plus antidiabetics followed by biphasic plus metformin) and
              single-stage insulin (biphasic plus metformin). For each
              approach, we analyzed multiple strategies. For each analysis,
              treatment steps were sequentially and cumulatively removed from
              the SOC until only the insulin steps remained. Delays in
              escalating treatment were evaluated by increasing the minimum
              time on a treatment within each strategy. The analysis time frame
              was 5 years. RESULTS: Relative to SOC, the two-stage insulin
              approach resulted in 0.10\% to 1.79\% more patients achieving
              target A1c (<7.0\%), at incremental costs of $95 to $3,267. (The
              ranges are due to the different strategies within the approach.)
              With the single-stage approach, 0.50\% to 2.63\% more patients
              achieved the target A1c compared with SOC at an incremental cost
              of -$1,642 to $1,177. Major diabetes-related complications were
              reduced by 0.38\% to 17.46\% using the two-stage approach and
              0.72\% to 25.92\% using the single-stage approach. Severe
              hypoglycemia increased by 17.97\% to 60.43\% using the two-stage
              approach and 6.44\% to 68.87\% using the single-stage approach.
              In the base case scenario, the minimum time on a specific
              treatment was 3 months. When the minimum time on each treatment
              was increased to 12 months (i.e., delayed), patients reaching A1c
              targets were reduced by 57\%, complications increased by 13\% to
              76\%, and mortality increased by 8\% over 5 years when compared
              with the base case for the SOC. However, severe hypoglycemic
              events were reduced by 83\%. CONCLUSIONS: As insulin was advanced
              earlier in therapy in the two-stage and single-stage approaches,
              patients reaching their A1c targets increased, severe
              hypoglycemic events increased, and diabetes-related complications
              and mortality decreased. Cost savings were estimated for 3 (of 4)
              strategies in the single-stage approach. Delays in treatment
              escalation substantially reduced patients reaching target A1c
              levels and increased the occurrence of major nonhypoglycemic
              diabetic complications. With the exception of substantial
              increases in severe hypoglycemic events, earlier use of insulin
              mitigates the clinical consequences of these delays.",

              demographic, epidemiological, and cancer data from Brazil, we
              developed a dynamic transmission model of HPV infection between
              males and females. Model-projected reductions in HPV incidence
              under different vaccination scenarios were applied to a
              stochastic model of cervical carcinogenesis to project lifetime
              costs and benefits. We assumed vaccination prevented HPV-16 and
              -18 infections in individuals not previously infected, and
              protection was lifelong. Coverage was varied from 0-90\% in both
              genders, and cost per-vaccinated individual was varied from IUSD
              25 to 400. At 90\% coverage, vaccinating girls alone reduced
              cancer risk by 63\%; including boys at this coverage level
              provided only 4\% further cancer reduction. At a cost

              characterised by a sequence of disease-modifying antirheumatic
              drugs (DMARDs) and biological response modifiers (BRMs). In most
              of the Western countries, the drug sequences are determined based
              on disease activity and treatment history of the patients. A
              model for realistic patient outcomes should reflect the treatment
              pathways relevant for patients with specific characteristics.
              OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at developing a model that could
              simulate long-term patient outcomes and cost effectiveness of
              treatment strategies with and without inclusion of BRMs following
              a clinical guideline for treatment decisions. METHODS: Discrete
              event simulation taking into account patient characteristics and
              treatment history was used for model development. Treatment
              effect on disease activity, costs, health utilities and times to
              events were estimated using Dutch observational studies.
              Long-term progression of physical functioning was quantified
              using a linear mixed-effects model. Costs and health utilities
              were estimated using two-part models. The treatment strategy
              recommended by the Dutch Society for Rheumatology where both
              DMARDs and BRMs were available (Strategy 2) was compared with the
              treatment strategy without BRMs (Strategy 1). Ten thousand
              theoretical patients were tracked individually until death. In
              the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, Monte Carlo simulations
              were performed with 1,000 sets of parameters sampled from
              appropriate probability distributions. RESULTS: The simulated
              changes over time in disease activity and physical functioning
              were plausible. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted
              life-year gained of Strategy 2 compared with Strategy 1 was
              124,011. At a willingness-to-pay threshold higher than 119,167,
              Strategy 2 dominated Strategy 1 in terms of cost effectiveness
              but the probability that the Strategy 2 is cost effective never
              exceeded 0.87. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to model the outcomes
              of complex treatment strategies based on a clinical guideline for
              the management of RA. Following the Dutch guideline and using
              real-life data, inclusion of BRMs in the treatment strategy for
              RA appeared to be less favourable in our model than in most of
              the existing models that compared drug sequences independent of
              patient characteristics and used data from randomised controlled
              clinical trials. Despite complexity and demand for extensive
              data, our modelling approach can help to identify the knowledge
              gaps in clinical guidelines for RA management and priorities for
              future research.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Although the medical system has expanded considerably
              over the past two decades in almost all countries, so too has the
              demand for health care. The radiology specialisation may be an
              early system indicator, being especially sensitive to changes in
              supply and demand in both rural and urban environments. The
              question is whether the new policies of increasing the number of
              radiologists can be a proper long-term solution for the imbalance
              of workforce supply and demand or not. METHODS: Using system
              dynamics modelling, we present our integrated descriptive models
              for the supply and demand of Australian radiologists to find the
              actual gap. Followed by this, we pose a prescriptive model for
              the supply in order to lessen the identified imbalance between
              supply and demand. Our system dynamics models compare the demand
              and supply of Australian radiologists over 40 years between 2010
              and 2050. RESULTS: The descriptive model shows that even if the
              radiology training program grows at a higher rate than the
              medical training growth rate and its own historical growth, the
              system will never be able to meet demand. The prescriptive model
              also indicates that although changing some influential factors
              (e.g the intake rate) reduces the level of imbalance, the system
              will still stay unstable during the study period. CONCLUSION: We
              posit that Australia may need to design a new system of radiology
              provision to meet future demands for high-quality medical
              radiation services. We also suggest some strategies, such as
              greater development of radiographers' role, are critical for
              enabling sustainable change over time. What is known about the
              topic? Long-term workforce planning for medical services at the
              national level has been very challenging for policy makers of the
              21st century. The current demographic imbalance in the supply and
              demand of the Australian radiologist workforce makes it difficult
              to plan the effects of extra inflow of radiology students over
              time.",

              initiation rapidly decreases virus burden, which reduces the
              number of transmittable viruses and thereby the probability of
              infection. However, HIV inevitably develops drug resistance,
              which leads to virus rebound and nullifies the effect of
              `treatment-for-prevention' for the time it remains unrecognized.
              While timely conducted treatment changes may avert periods of
              viral rebound, necessary treatment options and diagnostics may be
              lacking in resource-constrained settings. Within this work, we
              provide a mathematical platform for comparing different treatment
              paradigms that can be applied to many medical phenomena. We use
              this platform to optimize two distinct approaches for the
              treatment of HIV-1: (i) a diagnostic-guided treatment strategy,
              based on infrequent and patient-specific diagnostic schedules and
              (ii) a pro-active strategy that allows treatment adaptation prior
              to diagnostic ascertainment. Both strategies are compared to
              current clinical protocols (standard of care and the HPTN052
              protocol) in terms of patient health, economic means and
              reduction in HIV-1 onward transmission exemplarily for South
              Africa. All therapeutic strategies are assessed using a
              coarse-grained stochastic model of within-host HIV dynamics and
              pseudo-codes for solving the respective optimal control problems
              are provided. Our mathematical model suggests that both optimal
              strategies (i)-(ii) perform better than the current clinical
              protocols and no treatment in terms of economic means, life
              prolongation and reduction of HIV-transmission. The optimal
              diagnostic-guided strategy suggests rare diagnostics and performs
              similar to the optimal pro-active strategy. Our results suggest
              that 'treatment-for-prevention' may be further improved using
              either of the two analyzed treatment paradigms.",

              after early breast cancer, but there is no randomized controlled
              trial evidence to support this schedule over any other. Given
              that not all women have the same risk of recurrence, it is
              possible that, by defining different risk profiles, we could
              tailor mammographic schedules that are more effective and
              efficient. METHODS: A discrete event simulation model was
              developed to describe the progression of early breast cancer
              after completion of primary treatment. Retrospective data for
              1,100 postmenopausal women diagnosed with early breast cancer in
              South Australia from 2000 to 2008 were used to calibrate the
              model. Women were divided into four prognostic subgroups based on
              the Nottingham Prognostic Index of their primary tumor. For each
              subgroup, we compared the cost-effectiveness of three different
              mammographic schedules for two different age groups. RESULTS:
              Annual mammographic follow-up was not cost-effective for most
              postmenopausal women. Two yearly mammography was cost-effective
              for all women with excellent prognosis tumors; and for women with
              good prognosis tumors if high compliance rates can be achieved.
              Annual mammography for 5 years and 2 yearly surveillance
              thereafter (a mixed schedule) may be cost-effective for 50- to
              69-year-old women with moderate prognosis tumors, and for women
              aged 70-79 years with poor prognosis tumors. For younger women
              with poor prognosis tumors, annual mammography is potentially
              cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that
              mammographic follow-up could be tailored according to risk of
              recurrence. If validated with larger datasets, this could

              cancer death in the United States. Approximately 3\% of
              colorectal cancers are associated with Lynch Syndrome.
              Controversy exists regarding the optimal screening strategy for
              Lynch Syndrome. METHODS: Using an individual level
              microsimulation of a population affected by Lynch syndrome over
              several years, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 21
              screening strategies were compared. Modeling assumptions were
              based upon published literature, and sensitivity analyses were
              performed for key assumptions. In a two-step process, the number
              of Lynch syndrome diagnoses (Step 1) and life-years gained as a
              result of foreknowledge of Lynch syndrome in otherwise healthy
              carriers (Step 2) were measured. RESULTS: The optimal strategy
              was sequential screening for probands starting with a predictive
              model, then immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair protein
              expression (IHC), followed by germline mutation testing
              (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] of \$35 143 per
              life-year gained). The strategies of IHC + BRAF, germline testing
              and universal germline testing of colon cancer probands had ICERs
              of \$144 117 and \$996 878, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This
              analysis suggests that the initial step in screening for Lynch
              Syndrome should be the use of predictive models in probands.
              Universal tumor testing and general population screening
              strategies are not cost-effective. When family history is
              unavailable, alternate strategies are appropriate. Documentation

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Singapore's population, as that of many other
              countries, is aging; this is likely to lead to an increase in eye
              diseases and the demand for eye care. Since ophthalmologist
              training is long and expensive, early planning is essential. This
              paper forecasts workforce and training requirements for Singapore
              up to the year 2040 under several plausible future scenarios.
              METHODS: The Singapore Eye Care Workforce Model was created as a
              continuous time compartment model with explicit workforce stocks
              using system dynamics. The model has three modules: prevalence of
              eye disease, demand, and workforce requirements. The model is
              used to simulate the prevalence of eye diseases, patient visits,
              and workforce requirements for the public sector under different
              scenarios in order to determine training requirements. RESULTS:
              Four scenarios were constructed. Under the baseline
              business-as-usual scenario, the required number of
              ophthalmologists is projected to increase by 117\% from 2015 to
              2040. Under the current policy scenario (assuming an increase of
              service uptake due to increased awareness, availability, and
              accessibility of eye care services), the increase will be 175\%,
              while under the new model of care scenario (considering the
              additional effect of providing some services by
              non-ophthalmologists) the increase will only be 150\%. The
              moderated workload scenario (assuming in addition a reduction of
              the clinical workload) projects an increase in the required
              number of ophthalmologists of 192\% by 2040. Considering the
              uncertainties in the projected demand for eye care services,
              under the business-as-usual scenario, a residency intake of 8-22
              residents per year is required, 17-21 under the current policy
              scenario, 14-18 under the new model of care scenario, and, under
              the moderated workload scenario, an intake of 18-23 residents per
              year is required. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that under all
              scenarios considered, Singapore's aging and growing population
              will result in an almost doubling of the number of Singaporeans
              with eye conditions, a significant increase in public sector eye
              care demand and, consequently, a greater requirement for
              ophthalmologists.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: As in several other industrialized countries,
              Germany's statutory health insurance (SHI) is facing rising
              healthcare costs as well as the challenges caused by a
              double-aging society. The early detection and prevention of
              chronic diseases is considered a possible way to reduce the
              impact of these developments. However, controversy surrounds the
              costs and effects in terms of medical and financial outcomes of
              such programmes. OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost effectiveness of
              screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) from the
              perspective of the German SHI. The screening programme was
              compared with the current status quo (i.e. diagnosis of T2DM in
              routine clinical care or after the occurrence of the first
              clinical symptoms). Prevention strategies after diagnosis of
              pre-diabetes encompassed lifestyle and metformin interventions.
              METHODS: Effects of introducing screening for T2DM were assessed
              based on a Markov Monte Carlo microsimulation model. In contrast
              to a cohort model, this approach easily allows for detailed
              subgroup analysis accounting for the different characteristics of
              the general German population that would be targeted by the
              screening programme. Assessed endpoints included quality of life,
              lifetime costs, age at diabetes diagnosis, and incidence and age
              at occurrence of diabetes-related complications such as
              myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure and blindness.
              RESULTS: Screening for T2DM was cost effective in the general
              population by all commonly applied standards (euro562.54 per QALY
              for lifestyle intervention, euro325.44 per QALY for prevention
              with metformin [year 2006 values]) and even cost saving in the
              subgroup diagnosed with pre-diabetes and treated preventively.
              Occurrence of diabetes-related adverse events was reduced
              significantly and life expectancy was increased compared with no
              screening. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that early
              detection and disease prevention may be cost effective in the
              long term. However, additional political measures are necessary
              to support implementation, as the German SHI is currently lacking
              the necessary long-term incentives to support preventive

              outcomes and more efficient use of resources. METHODS: MODEM
              starts with a systematic mapping of the literature on effective
              and (potentially) cost-effective interventions in dementia care.
              Those findings, as well as data from a cohort, will then be used
              to model the quality of life and cost impacts of making these
              evidence-based interventions more widely available in England
              over the period from now to 2040. Modelling will use a suite of
              models, combining microsimulation and macrosimulation methods,
              modelling the costs and outcomes of care, both for an individual
              over the life-course from the point of dementia diagnosis, and
              for individuals and England as a whole in a particular year.

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: The demand for long-term care (LTC) services is
              likely to increase as a population ages. Keeping pace with rising
              demand for LTC poses a key challenge for health systems and
              policymakers, who may be slow to scale up capacity. Given that
              Singapore is likely to face increasing demand for both acute and
              LTC services, this paper examines the dynamic impact of different
              LTC capacity response policies, which differ in the amount of
              time over which LTC capacity is increased, on acute care
              utilization and the demand for LTC and acute care professionals.
              METHODS: The modeling methodology of System Dynamics (SD) was
              applied to create a simplified, aggregate, computer simulation
              model for policy exploration. This model stimulates the
              interaction between persons with LTC needs (i.e., elderly
              individuals aged 65 years and older who have functional
              limitations that require human assistance) and the capacity of
              the healthcare system (i.e., acute and LTC services, including
              community-based and institutional care) to provide care. Because
              the model is intended for policy exploration, stylized numbers
              were used as model inputs. To discern policy effects, the model
              was initialized in a steady state. The steady state was disturbed
              by doubling the number of people needing LTC over the 30-year
              simulation time. Under this demand change scenario, the effects
              of various LTC capacity response policies were studied and
              sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Compared to
              proactive and quick adjustment LTC capacity response policies,
              slower adjustment LTC capacity response policies (i.e., those for
              which the time to change LTC capacity is longer) tend to shift
              care demands to the acute care sector and increase total care
              needs. CONCLUSIONS: Greater attention to demand in the acute care
              sector relative to demand for LTC may result in over-building
              acute care facilities and filling them with individuals whose
              needs are better suited for LTC. Policymakers must be equally
              proactive in expanding LTC capacity, lest unsustainable acute
              care utilization and significant deficits in the number of
              healthcare professionals arise. Delaying LTC expansion could, for
              example, lead to increased healthcare expenditure and longer wait
              lists for LTC and acute care patients.",

              local health departments play an increasingly prominent role
              leading and coordinating disease prevention programs in the
              United States. This case study shows how a local health
              department working in chronic disease prevention and management
              can use systems science and evidence-based decision making to
              inform program selection, implementation, and assessment; enhance
              engagement with local health systems and organizations; and
              possibly optimize health care delivery and population health.
              METHODS: The authors built a systems-science agent-based
              simulation model of diabetes progression for the San Antonio
              Metropolitan Health District, a local health department, to
              simulate health and cost outcomes for the population of San
              Antonio for a 20-year period (2015-2034) using 2 scenarios: 1 in
              which hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values for a population were similar
              to the current distribution of values in San Antonio, and the
              other with a hypothetical 1-percentage-point reduction in HbA1c
              values. RESULTS: They projected that a 1-percentage-point
              reduction in HbA1c would lead to a decrease in the 20-year
              prevalence of end-stage renal disease from 1.7\% to 0.9\%, lower
              extremity amputation from 4.6\% to 2.9\%, blindness from 15.1\%

              stroke from 9.8\% to 7.2\%. They estimated annual direct medical
              cost savings (in 2015 US dollars) from reducing HbA1c by 1
              percentage point ranging from $6842 (myocardial infarction) to
              $39 800 (end-stage renal disease) for each averted case of

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Inadequate bowel preparation during screening
              colonoscopy necessitates repeating colonoscopy. Studies suggest
              inadequate bowel preparation rates of 20-60\%. This increases the
              cost of colonoscopy for our society. AIM: The aim of this study
              is to determine the impact of inadequate bowel preparation rate
              on the cost effectiveness of colonoscopy compared to other
              screening strategies for colorectal cancer (CRC). METHODS: A
              microsimulation model of CRC screening strategies for the general
              population at average risk for CRC. The strategies include fecal
              immunochemistry test (FIT) every year, colonoscopy every ten
              years, sigmoidoscopy every five years, or stool DNA test every 3
              years. The screening could be performed at private practice
              offices, outpatient hospitals, and ambulatory surgical centers.
              RESULTS: At the current assumed inadequate bowel preparation rate
              of 25\%, the cost of colonoscopy as a screening strategy is above
              society's willingness to pay (<\$50,000/QALY). Threshold analysis
              demonstrated that an inadequate bowel preparation rate of 13\% or
              less is necessary before colonoscopy is considered more cost
              effective than FIT. At inadequate bowel preparation rates of
              25\%, colonoscopy is still more cost effective compared to
              sigmoidoscopy and stool DNA test. Sensitivity analysis of all
              inputs adjusted by $\pm$10\% showed incremental cost
              effectiveness ratio values were influenced most by the
              specificity, adherence, and sensitivity of FIT and colonoscopy.
              CONCLUSIONS: Screening colonoscopy is not a cost effective
              strategy when compared with fecal immunochemical test, as long as
              the inadequate bowel preparation rate is greater than 13\%.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: In the Netherlands, low cervical cancer incidence and
              mortality rates might limit the cost-effectiveness of vaccination
              against the human papillomavirus (HPV). We examined the effect on
              cervical cancer incidence and mortality of adding HPV vaccination
              to the current Dutch cervical cancer screening situation and
              calculated the cost-effectiveness. METHODS: Costs and effects
              were estimated under favorable assumptions (ie, that HPV
              vaccination provides lifelong protection against 70\% of all
              cervical cancers, has no side effects, and is administered to all
              women regardless of their risk of cervical cancer) by using the
              microsimulation screening analysis (MISCAN) model. The impact of
              changes in the price of vaccination, number of booster
              vaccinations, vaccination attendance rate, vaccination efficacy,
              cervical cancer incidence level, and quality-of-life assumptions
              was investigated in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Using the
              current price of euro118 per vaccine dose and with discounting of
              costs and effects at an annual rate of 3\%, adding HPV
              vaccination to the current Dutch screening situation had a
              cost-effectiveness ratio of euro53 500 per quality-adjusted
              life-year (QALY) gained. The threshold price per vaccine dose at
              which the cost-effectiveness of vaccination would correspond to
              an acceptability threshold of euro20 000 per QALY gained was
              euro40. With the addition of one or more (up to four) booster
              vaccinations during a lifetime, this threshold price decreased to
              euro33 for one booster (to euro16 for four boosters). With a
              doubling of the cervical cancer incidence level, the
              cost-effectiveness ratio was euro24 400 per QALY gained and the
              maximum price per dose at threshold of euro20 000 was euro97. All
              threshold prices were lower under less favorable effectiveness
              assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: In the Netherlands, HPV vaccination is
              not cost-effective even under favorable assumptions. To become
              cost-effective, the vaccine price would have to be decreased
              considerably, depending on the effectiveness of the vaccine.",

              and cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical HIV chemoprophylaxis
              program among men who have sex with men in a large US city.
              DESIGN AND METHODS: We developed a stochastic compartmental
              mathematical model using HIV/AIDS surveillance data to simulate
              the HIV epidemic and the impact of a 5-year chemoprophylaxis
              program under varying assumptions for epidemiological,
              behavioral, programmatic and cost parameters. We estimated
              program effectiveness and costs from the perspective of the US
              healthcare system compared with current HIV prevention practices.
              The main outcome measures were number of HIV infections prevented
              and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-years saved.
              RESULTS: A chemoprophylaxis program targeting 25\% of high-risk
              men who have sex with men in New York City could prevent 780
              (4\%) to 4510 (23\%) of the 19 510 HIV infections predicted to
              occur among all men who have sex with men in New York City in 5
              years. More than half of prevented infections would be among
              those not taking chemoprophylaxis but who benefit from reduced

              (MISCAN) and Simulation Model of CRC (SimCRC)] to project CRC
              screening and treatment costs under 2 scenarios, starting in
              2010: ``current trends'' (60\% of the population up-to-date with
              screening recommendations) and ``enhanced participation'' (70\%
              up-to-date). The population was scaled to the projected US
              population for each year between 2010 and 2060. Costs per year
              were derived by age group (50-64 and 65+ y). RESULTS: By 2060,
              the discounted cumulative total costs in the pre-Medicare
              population were $35.7 and $28.1 billion higher with enhanced

              ($252.1 billion with MISCAN and $239.5 billion with SimCRC,
              respectively). Because of CRC treatment savings with enhanced
              participation, cumulative costs in the Medicare population were
              $18.3 and $32.7 billion lower (current trends: $423.5 billion
              with MISCAN and $372.8 billion with SimCRC). Over the 50-year
              time horizon an estimated 60\% (MISCAN) and 89\% (SimCRC) of the
              increased screening costs could be offset by savings in Medicare

              reduce emergency department (ED) visits and associated
              hospitalizations among their assigned patients to be cost-neutral
              from a payer's perspective. RESEARCH DESIGN: Using a
              microsimulation of patient health care utilization, costs, and
              revenues, we estimated what portion of ED visits and
              hospitalizations for different conditions would need to be
              prevented by a CHW program to fully pay for the program's
              expenses. The model simulated CHW programs enrolling patients
              with a history of at least 1 ED visit for a chronic condition in
              the prior year, utilizing data on utilization and cost from
              national sources. RESULTS: CHWs assigned to patients with
              uncontrolled hypertension and congestive heart failure, as
              compared with other common conditions, achieve cost-neutrality
              with the lowest number of averted visits to the ED. To achieve
              cost-neutrality, 4-5 visits to the ED would need to be averted
              per year by a CHW assigned a panel of 70 patients with
              uncontrolled hypertension or congestive heart
              failure-approximately 3\%-4\% of typical ED visits among such
              patients, respectively. Most other chronic conditions would
              require between 7\% and 12\% of ED visits to be averted to
              achieve cost-savings. CONCLUSION: Offsetting costs of a CHW
              program is theoretically feasible for many common conditions. Yet

              low-impact airport attack, and 54,729 deaths in a scenario
              involving a high-impact airport attack. Immediate vaccination of
              the public in an attacked region would provide little additional
              benefit. Prior vaccination of health care workers, who would be
              disproportionately affected, would save lives in large local or
              national attacks but would cause 25 deaths nationally. Prior
              vaccination of health care workers and the public would save
              lives in a national attack but would cause 482 deaths nationally.
              The expected net benefits of vaccination depend on the assessed
              probability of an attack. Prior vaccination of health care
              workers would be expected to save lives if the probability of a
              building attack exceeded 0.22 or if the probability of a
              high-impact airport attack exceeded 0.002. The probability would
              have to be much higher to make vaccination of the public
              life-saving. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis favors prior vaccination
              of health care workers unless the likelihood of any attack is
              very low, but it favors vaccination of the public only if the
              likelihood of a national attack or of multiple attacks is high.",

              (NICE) clinical guidelines (CGs) make recommendations across
              large, complex care pathways for broad groups of patients. They
              rely on cost-effectiveness evidence from the literature and from
              new analyses for selected high-priority topics. An alternative
              approach would be to build a model of the full care pathway and
              to use this as a platform to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of
              multiple topics across the guideline recommendations. OBJECTIVES:
              In this project we aimed to test the feasibility of building full
              guideline models for NICE guidelines and to assess if, and how,
              such models can be used as a basis for cost-effectiveness
              analysis (CEA). DATA SOURCES: A 'best evidence' approach was used
              to inform the model parameters. Data were drawn from the
              guideline documentation, advice from clinical experts and rapid
              literature reviews on selected topics. Where possible we relied
              on good-quality, recent UK systematic reviews and meta-analyses.
              REVIEW METHODS: Two published NICE guidelines were used as case
              studies: prostate cancer and atrial fibrillation (AF). Discrete
              event simulation (DES) was used to model the recommended care
              pathways and to estimate consequent costs and outcomes. For each
              guideline, researchers not involved in model development collated
              a shortlist of topics suggested for updating. The modelling teams
              then attempted to evaluate options related to these topics.
              Cost-effectiveness results were compared with opinions about the
              importance of the topics elicited in a survey of stakeholders.
              RESULTS: The modelling teams developed simulations of the
              guideline pathways and disease processes. Development took longer
              and required more analytical time than anticipated. Estimates of
              cost-effectiveness were produced for six of the nine prostate
              cancer topics considered, and for five of eight AF topics. The
              other topics were not evaluated owing to lack of data or time
              constraints. The modelled results suggested 'economic priorities'
              for an update that differed from priorities expressed in the
              stakeholder survey. LIMITATIONS: We did not conduct systematic
              reviews to inform the model parameters, and so the results might
              not reflect all current evidence. Data limitations and time
              constraints restricted the number of analyses that we could
              conduct. We were also unable to obtain feedback from guideline
              stakeholders about the usefulness of the models within project
              time scales. CONCLUSIONS: Discrete event simulation can be used
              to model full guideline pathways for CEA, although this requires
              a substantial investment of clinical and analytic time and
              expertise. For some topics lack of data may limit the potential
              for modelling. There are also uncertainties over the
              accessibility and adaptability of full guideline models. However,
              full guideline modelling offers the potential to strengthen and
              extend the analytical basis of NICE's CGs. Further work is needed
              to extend the analysis of our case study models to estimate
              population-level budget and health impacts. The practical
              usefulness of our models to guideline developers and users should
              also be investigated, as should the feasibility and usefulness of
              whole guideline modelling alongside development of a new CG.

              financial risk that is frequently managed by cancelling elective
              surgical procedures. It is uncertain how different scheduling
              rules affect the rate of elective surgery cancellations. METHODS:
              We used discrete event simulation modelling to represent
              perioperative processes at a hospital in Toronto, Canada. We
              tested the effects of the following 3 scenarios on the number of
              surgical cancellations: scheduling surgeons' operating days based
              on their patients' average length of stay in hospital, sequencing
              surgical procedures by average duration and variance, and
              increasing the number of postsurgical ward beds. RESULTS: The
              number of elective cancellations was reduced by scheduling
              surgeons whose patients had shorter average lengths of stay in
              hospital earlier in the week, sequencing shorter surgeries and
              those with less variance in duration earlier in the day, and by
              adding up to 2 additional beds to the postsurgical ward.

  abstract = "The effectiveness of vaccinating males against the human
              papillomavirus (HPV) remains a controversial subject. Many
              existing studies conclude that increasing female coverage is more
              effective than diverting resources into male vaccination.
              Recently, several empirical studies on HPV immunization have been
              published, providing evidence of the fact that marginal
              vaccination costs increase with coverage. In this study, we use a
              stochastic agent-based modeling framework to revisit the male
              vaccination debate in light of these new findings. Within this
              framework, we assess the impact of coverage-dependent marginal
              costs of vaccine distribution on optimal immunization strategies
              against HPV. Focusing on the two scenarios of ongoing and new
              vaccination programs, we analyze different resource allocation
              policies and their effects on overall disease burden. Our results
              suggest that if the costs associated with vaccinating males are
              relatively close to those associated with vaccinating females,
              then coverage-dependent, increasing marginal costs may favor
              vaccination strategies that entail immunization of both genders.
              In particular, this study emphasizes the necessity for further
              empirical research on the nature of coverage-dependent

  author   = "Subramanian, Sujha and Bobashev, Georgiy and Morris, Robert J",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Obtaining regular screening exams can significantly
              reduce colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality. Most CRC models to date
              have assumed ``ideal conditions'' such as 100\% compliance, and
              the effects of CRC screening tests have been assessed only under
              these conditions. In this study, we assess cost-effectiveness
              incorporating real-world patient preferences and compliance.
              METHODOLOGY: We built an agent-based simulation model to assess
              the effect of compliance and patient preferences. Baseline values
              were derived from the 2003 and 2005 National Health Interview
              Survey, and effectiveness and cost parameters were obtained
              through literature review. Initial screening compliance was 45\%,
              and compliance with follow-up diagnostic tests was 75\%. RESULTS:
              The current level of screening reduces CRC mortality by 44.1\%
              when compared with no screening. Increasing diagnostic follow-up
              compliance to 95\% can lead to an additional 9.3\% reduction in
              CRC mortality, whereas increasing initial screening compliance to
              95\% can result in an additional 50.4\% reduction. These
              increases can be achieved at a cost of about $7,500
              ($1,309-$32,864) per life year saved and $14,000 ($3,620-$35,855)
              per life year saved for diagnostic follow-up and initial
              screening tests, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing compliance
              with both initial screening test recommendation and diagnostic
              testing are cost-effective approaches. The most cost-effective
              approach under limited funding is to increase compliance with
              diagnostic testing for those already being screened. Targeted
              interventions, which are necessary to increase compliance, are
              generally cost-effective under the base case scenarios presented
              in this model, but additional studies are required to identify
              the most cost-effective approach.",

              disease (AD) at an early stage should improve the quality of life
              of the patient and caregiver. In the United Kingdom,
              cost-effectiveness of early assessment of individuals presenting
              with subjective memory complaints and treating those with AD with
              donepezil was evaluated. METHODS: A discrete event simulation of
              AD progression and the effect of treatment interventions was
              developed. Patient-level data from donepezil trials and a 7-year
              follow-up registry were used to model correlated longitudinal
              rates of change in cognition, behavior, and function. Other
              epidemiological and health services data, including estimates of
              undiagnosed dementia and delays in diagnosis, were based on
              published sources. Simulated individuals were followed up for 10
              years. RESULTS: In the base-case estimates, 17 patients need to
              be assessed to diagnose one patient with AD, resulting in an
              average assessment cost of \pounds{}4100 ($6000; $1 US =
              \pounds{}0.68 UK) per patient diagnosed (2007 cost year). In
              comparison with a scenario without early assessment or
              pharmacologic treatment, early assessment reduces health care
              costs by \pounds{}3600 ($5300) per patient and societal costs by
              \pounds{}{}7750 ($11,400). Savings are also substantial compared
              with treatment without early assessment, averaging \pounds{}2100
              ($3100) in health care costs, and \pounds{}{}5700 ($8400) in
              societal costs. Results are most sensitive to estimates of
              patient care costs and the probability of patients reporting
              subjective memory complaints. In probabilistic sensitivity
              analysis, early assessment leads to savings or is highly
              cost-effective in the majority of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Although
              early assessment has significant up-front costs, identifying AD
              patients at an early stage results in cost savings and health
              benefits compared with no treatment or treatment in the absence

              10,000 patients. Universal decolonization was the least expensive
              strategy and was more effective compared with all strategies
              except UCP+decolonization and UCP+chlorhexidine gluconate.
              UCP+decolonization was more effective than universal
              decolonization but would cost $2469 per colonization averted and
              $9007 per infection averted. If MRSA colonization prevalence
              decreases from 12\% to 5\%, active surveillance cultures plus
              selective decolonization becomes the least expensive strategy.
              CONCLUSIONS Universal decolonization is cost-saving, preventing
              44\% of cases of MRSA colonization and 45\% of cases of MRSA
              infection. Our model provides useful guidance for decision makers
              choosing between multiple available hospital-based strategies to
              prevent MRSA transmission.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Low dietary quality is a key contributor to obesity
              and related illnesses, and lower income is generally associated
              with worse dietary profiles. The unequal geographic distribution
              of healthy food resources could be a key contributor to income
              disparities in dietary profiles. PURPOSE: To explore the role
              that economic segregation can have in creating income differences
              in healthy eating and to explore policy levers that may be
              appropriate for countering income disparities in diet. METHODS: A
              simple agent-based model was used to identify segregation
              patterns that generate income disparities in diet. The capacity
              for household food preferences and relative pricing of healthy
              foods to overcome or exacerbate the differential was explored.
              RESULTS: Absent other factors, income differentials in diet
              resulted from the segregation of high-income households and
              healthy food stores from low-income households and unhealthy food
              stores. When both income groups shared a preference for healthy
              foods, low-income diets improved but a disparity remained. Both
              favorable preferences and relatively cheap healthy foods were
              necessary to overcome the differential generated by segregation.
              CONCLUSIONS: The model underscores the challenges of fostering
              favorable behavior change when people and resources are
              residentially segregated and behaviors are motivated or
              constrained by multiple factors. Simulation modeling can be a
              useful tool for proposing and testing policies or interventions
              that will ultimately be implemented in a complex system where the

              data from the 2006 New Zealand Tobacco Use Survey and other
              sources and developed a system dynamics model with the iThink
              computer simulation package. The model derived estimates of

              these over a 50-year period, from 2001 to 2051, under

              RESULTS: The model predicted larger effects by 2051 with the
              enhanced cessation than with the business-as-usual scenario,
              including: an 11\% greater decline in adult current smoking
              prevalence (9 versus 10 per 100 people), 16\% greater decline in

              admitted to a hospital within the Premier network. INTERVENTIONS:
              None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Using Premier data
              (2008-2012), ICU resource utilization and costs were tracked over
              a 1-year time horizon for 2,097,563 patients with chronic
              life-limiting illness. Using a Markov microsimulation model, we
              explored the potential cost savings from the hospital system
              perspective under a variety of scenarios by varying the
              interventions' efficacies and availabilities. Of 2,097,563
              patients, 657,825 (31\%) used the ICU during the 1-year time
              horizon; mean ICU spending per patient was 11.3k (SD, 17.6k). In
              the base-case analysis, if in-hospital advance care planning and
              ICU-based palliative care consultation were systematically
              provided, we estimated a mean reduction in ICU costs of 2.8k (SD,
              14.5k) per patient and an ICU cost saving of 25\%. Among the
              simulated patients who used the ICU, the receipt of both

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Australian pharmacotherapy maintenance
              programs incur costs to patients. These dispensing fees represent
              a financial burden to patients and are inconsistent with
              Australian health-care principles. No previous work has examined
              the current costs nor the future predicted costs if government
              subsidised dispensing fees. DESIGN AND METHODS: A system dynamics
              model, which simulated the flow of patients into and out of
              methadone maintenance treatment, was developed. Costs were
              imputed from existing research data. The approach enabled
              simulation of possible behavioural responses to a fee subsidy
              (such as higher retention) and new estimates of costs were
              derived under such scenarios. RESULTS: Current modelled costs
              (AUS$11.73m per month) were largely borne by state/territory
              government (43\%), with patients bearing one-third (33\%) of the
              total costs and the Commonwealth one-quarter (24\%). Assuming no
              behavioural changes associated with fee subsidies, the cost of
              subsidising the dispensing fees of Australian methadone patients
              would be $3.9m per month. If retention were improved as a result
              of fee subsidy, treatment numbers would increase and the model
              estimates an additional cost of $0.8m per month. If this was
              coupled with greater numbers entering treatment, the costs would
              increase by a further $0.4m per month. In total, full fee subsidy
              with modelled behavioural changes would increase per annum
              government expenditure by $81.8m to $175.8m. DISCUSSION AND
              CONCLUSIONS: If government provided dispensing fee relief for
              methadone maintenance patients, it would be a costly exercise.
              However, these additional costs are offset by the social and
              health gains achieved from the methadone maintenance program.",

  author   = "Buttenheim, Alison M and Cherng, Sarah T and Asch, David A",
  abstract = "Many pediatric practices have adopted vaccine policies that
              require parents who refuse to vaccinate according to the ACIP
              schedule to find another health care provider. Such policies may
              inadvertently cluster unvaccinated patients into practices that
              tolerate non vaccination or alternative schedules, turning them
              into risky pockets of low herd immunity. The objective of this
              study was to assess the effect of provider zero-tolerance
              vaccination policies on the clustering of intentionally
              unvaccinated children. We developed an agent-based model of
              parental vaccine hesitancy, provider non-vaccination tolerance,
              and selection of patients into pediatric practices. We ran 84
              experiments across a range of parental hesitancy and provider
              tolerance scenarios. When the model is initialized, all providers
              accommodate refusals and intentionally unvaccinated children are
              evenly distributed across providers. As provider tolerance
              decreases, hesitant children become more clustered in a smaller
              number of practices and eventually are not able to find a
              practice that will accept them. Each of these effects becomes
              more pronounced as the level of hesitancy in the population
              rises. Heterogeneity in practice tolerance to vaccine-hesitant
              parents has the unintended result of concentrating susceptible
              individuals within a small number of tolerant practices, while
              providing little if any compensatory protection to adherent

              epidemic in society. DESIGN: Agent-based microsimulation model of

              PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTIONS: Risk-based and universal
              opt-out hepatitis C screening in prisons, followed by treatment
              in a portion of patients. OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevention of HCV
              transmission and associated disease in prisons and society,
              costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental
              cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and total prison budget. RESULTS
              OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Implementing risk-based and opt-out
              screening could diagnose 41,900 to 122,700 new HCV cases in
              prisons in the next 30 years. Compared with no screening, these
              scenarios could prevent 5500 to 12,700 new HCV infections caused
              by released inmates, wherein about 90\% of averted infections
              would have occurred outside of prisons. Screening could also
              prevent 4200 to 11,700 liver-related deaths. The ICERs of
              screening scenarios were \$19,600 to \$29,200 per QALY, and the
              respective first-year prison budget was \$900 to \$1150 million.
              Prisons would require an additional 12.4\% of their current
              health care budget to implement such interventions. RESULTS OF
              SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results were sensitive to the time horizon,
              and ICERs otherwise remained less than \$50,000 per QALY.
              LIMITATION: Data on transmission network, reinfection rate, and
              opt-out HCV screening rate are lacking. CONCLUSION: Universal
              opt-out HCV screening in prisons is highly cost-effective and
              would reduce HCV transmission and HCV-associated diseases
              primarily in the outside community. Investing in U.S. prisons to
              manage hepatitis C is a strategic approach to address the current

              virus infection on a layout based on a representative hospital
              emergency department in Winnipeg, Canada. In doing so, the study
              complements mathematical modeling techniques for disease spread,
              as well as modeling applications focused on the spread of
              antibiotic-resistant nosocomial infections in hospitals. Twenty
              different emergency department scenarios were simulated, with
              further simulation of four infection control strategies. The
              agent-based modeling approach represents systems modeling, in
              which the emergency department was modeled as a collection of
              agents (patients and healthcare workers) and their individual
              characteristics, behaviors, and interactions. The framework was
              coded in C++ using Qt4 libraries running under the Linux
              operating system. A simple ordinary least squares (OLS)
              regression was used to analyze the data, in which the percentage
              of patients that became infected in one day within the simulation
              was the dependent variable. The results suggest that within the
              given instance context, patient-oriented infection control
              policies (alternate treatment streams, masking symptomatic
              patients) tend to have a larger effect than policies that target
              healthcare workers. The agent-based modeling framework is a
              flexible tool that can be made to reflect any given environment;
              it is also a decision support tool for practitioners and
              policymakers to assess the relative impact of infection control
              strategies. The framework illuminates scenarios worthy of further
              investigation, as well as counterintuitive findings.",

              difficile (C. difficile) transmission. We conducted an economic
              evaluation of ``bundling'' these strategies together. METHODS: We
              constructed an agent-based computer simulation of nosocomial C.
              difficile transmission and infection in a hospital setting. This
              model included the following components: interactions between
              patients and health care workers; room contamination via C.
              difficile shedding; C. difficile hand carriage and removal via
              hand hygiene; patient acquisition of C. difficile via contact
              with contaminated rooms or health care workers; and patient
              antimicrobial use. Six interventions were introduced alone and
              ``bundled'' together: (a) aggressive C. difficile testing; (b)
              empiric isolation and treatment of symptomatic patients; (c)
              improved adherence to hand hygiene and (d) contact precautions;
              (e) improved use of soap and water for hand hygiene; and (f)
              improved environmental cleaning. Our analysis compared these
              interventions using values representing 3 different scenarios:
              (1) base-case (BASE) values that reflect typical hospital
              practice, (2) intervention (INT) values that represent
              implementation of hospital-wide efforts to reduce C. diff
              transmission, and (3) optimal (OPT) values representing the
              highest expected results from strong adherence to the
              interventions. Cost parameters for each intervention were
              obtained from published literature. We performed our analyses
              assuming low, normal, and high C. difficile importation
              prevalence and transmissibility of C. difficile. RESULTS: INT
              levels of the ``bundled'' intervention were cost-effective at a
              willingness-to-pay threshold of \$100,000/quality-adjusted
              life-year in all importation prevalence and transmissibility
              scenarios. OPT levels of intervention were cost-effective for
              normal and high importation prevalence and transmissibility
              scenarios. When analyzed separately, hand hygiene compliance,
              environmental decontamination, and empiric isolation and
              treatment were the interventions that had the greatest impact on
              both cost and effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of
              available interventions to prevent CDI is likely to be
              cost-effective but the cost-effectiveness varies for different
              levels of intensity of the interventions depending on

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: A practical and ethical challenge in advance care
              planning research is controlling and intervening on human
              behavior. Additionally, observing dynamic changes in advance care
              planning (ACP) behavior proves difficult, though tracking changes
              over time is important for intervention development. Agent-based
              modeling (ABM) allows researchers to integrate complex behavioral
              data about advance care planning behaviors and thought processes
              into a controlled environment that is more easily alterable and
              observable. Literature to date has not addressed how best to
              motivate individuals, increase facilitators and reduce barriers
              associated with ACP. We aimed to build an ABM that applies the
              Transtheoretical Model of behavior change to ACP as a health
              behavior and accurately reflects: 1) the rates at which
              individuals complete the process, 2) how individuals respond to
              barriers, facilitators, and behavioral variables, and 3) the
              interactions between these variables. METHODS: We developed a
              dynamic ABM of the ACP decision making process based on the
              stages of change posited by the Transtheoretical Model. We
              integrated barriers, facilitators, and other behavioral variables
              that agents encounter as they move through the process. RESULTS:
              We successfully incorporated ACP barriers, facilitators, and
              other behavioral variables into our ABM, forming a plausible
              representation of ACP behavior and decision-making. The resulting
              distributions across the stages of change replicated those found
              in the literature, with approximately half of participants in the
              action-maintenance stage in both the model and the literature.
              CONCLUSIONS: Our ABM is a useful method for representing dynamic
              social and experiential influences on the ACP decision making
              process. This model suggests structural interventions, e.g.
              increasing access to ACP materials in primary care clinics, in
              addition to improved methods of data collection for behavioral
              studies, e.g. incorporating longitudinal data to capture

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Despite widespread immunization programs, a clear
              increase in pertussis incidence is apparent in many developed
              countries during the last decades. Consequently, additional
              immunization strategies are considered to reduce the burden of
              disease. The aim of this study is to design an individual-based
              stochastic dynamic framework to model pertussis transmission in
              the population in order to predict the epidemiologic and economic
              consequences of the implementation of universal booster
              vaccination programs. Using this framework, we estimate the
              cost-effectiveness of universal adolescent pertussis booster
              vaccination at the age of 12 years in the Netherlands.
              METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We designed a discrete event
              simulation (DES) model to predict the epidemiological and
              economic consequences of implementing universal adolescent
              booster vaccination. We used national age-specific notification
              data over the period 1996-2000--corrected for underreporting--to
              calibrate the model assuming a steady state situation.
              Subsequently, booster vaccination was introduced. Input
              parameters of the model were derived from literature, national
              data sources (e.g. costing data, incidence and hospitalization
              data) and expert opinions. As there is no consensus on the
              duration of immunity acquired by natural infection, we considered
              two scenarios for this duration of protection (i.e. 8 and 15
              years). In both scenarios, total pertussis incidence decreased as
              a result of adolescent vaccination. From a societal perspective,
              the cost-effectiveness was estimated at €4418/QALY (range:
              3205-6364 € per QALY) and €6371/QALY (range: 4139-9549 € per
              QALY) for the 8- and 15-year protection scenarios, respectively.
              Sensitivity analyses revealed that the outcomes are most
              sensitive to the quality of life weights used for pertussis
              disease. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: To our knowledge we designed
              the first individual-based dynamic framework to model pertussis
              transmission in the population. This study indicates that
              adolescent pertussis vaccination is likely to be a cost-effective
              intervention for The Netherlands. The model is suited to
              investigate further pertussis booster vaccination strategies.",

              work can achieve substantial co-benefits for health, social
              equity, and climate change mitigation. Previous integrated
              modeling of transport scenarios has assumed active transport mode
              share and has been unable to incorporate acknowledged system
              feedbacks. OBJECTIVES: We compared the effects of policies to
              increase bicycle commuting in a car-dominated city and explored
              the role of participatory modeling to support transport planning
              in the face of complexity. METHODS: We used system dynamics
              modeling (SDM) to compare realistic policies, incorporating
              feedback effects, nonlinear relationships, and time delays
              between variables. We developed a system dynamics model of
              commuter bicycling through interviews and workshops with policy,
              community, and academic stakeholders. We incorporated best
              available evidence to simulate five policy scenarios over the
              next 40 years in Auckland, New Zealand. Injury, physical
              activity, fuel costs, air pollution, and carbon emissions
              outcomes were simulated. RESULTS: Using the simulation model, we
              demonstrated the kinds of policies that would likely be needed to
              change a historical pattern of decline in cycling into a pattern
              of growth that would meet policy goals. Our model projections
              suggest that transforming urban roads over the next 40 years,
              using best practice physical separation on main roads and
              bicycle-friendly speed reduction on local streets, would yield
              benefits 10-25 times greater than costs. CONCLUSIONS: To our
              knowledge, this is the first integrated simulation model of
              future specific bicycling policies. Our projections provide
              practical evidence that may be used by health and transport
              policy makers to optimize the benefits of transport bicycling
              while minimizing negative consequences in a cost-effective
              manner. The modeling process enhanced understanding by a range of
              stakeholders of cycling as a complex system. Participatory SDM

              agent took part in the process of allocating resources based on
              their observation in their respective sections, which gave the
              system the advantage of utilizing all the available human
              resources during the workday by being allocated to a different
              section. In this simulation, unlike previous studies, all staff
              agents took part in the decision-making process to re-allocate
              the resources in the emergency department. The simulation modeled
              the behavior of patients, receptionists, triage nurses, emergency

              (MDRO), which are associated with high rates of morbidity and
              mortality. Current guidelines to reduce transmission of MDRO in
              the out-patient dialysis unit are targeted at patients considered
              to be high-risk for transmitting these organisms: those with
              infected skin wounds not contained by a dressing, or those with

  abstract = "Although it is widely known that the occurrence of depression
              increases over the course of adolescence, symptoms of mood
              disorders frequently go undetected. While schools are viable
              settings for conducting universal screening to systematically
              identify students in need of services for common health
              conditions, particularly those that adversely affect school
              performance, few school districts routinely screen their students
              for depression. Among the most commonly referenced barriers are
              concerns that the number of students identified may exceed
              schools' service delivery capacities, but few studies have
              evaluated this concern systematically. System dynamics (SD)
              modeling may prove a useful approach for answering questions of
              this sort. The goal of the current paper is therefore to
              demonstrate how SD modeling can be applied to inform
              implementation decisions in communities. In our demonstration, we
              used SD modeling to estimate the additional service demand
              generated by universal depression screening in a typical high
              school. We then simulated the effects of implementing
              ``compensatory approaches'' designed to address anticipated
              increases in service need through (1) the allocation of
              additional staff time and (2) improvements in the effectiveness
              of mental health interventions. Results support the ability of
              screening to facilitate more rapid entry into services and
              suggest that improving the effectiveness of mental health
              services for students with depression via the implementation of
              an evidence-based treatment protocol may have a limited impact on
              overall recovery rates and service availability. In our example,
              the SD approach proved useful in informing systems'

               simulating the operation of an ED using a model that represents
               the flow of patients through the department.Methods This study
               was based on a district general hospital in West London. To
               ascertain patients9 length of stay, the hospital9s historical
               records and staff rotas were used to obtain data on activities,
               timeframes and resources on three separate representative weeks

              functionality are compromised when inefficient coordination

              determine how bed demand from competing cardiology admission
              sources affects ED patients' access to inpatient cardiac care.
              METHODS: A stochastic discrete event simulation of hospital
              patient flow predicted ED patient boarding time, defined as the
              time interval between cardiology admission request to inpatient
              bed placement, as the primary outcome measure. The simulation was
              built and tested from 1 year of patient flow data and was used to
              examine prospective strategies to reduce cardiology patient
              boarding time. RESULTS: Boarding time for the 1,591 ED patients
              who were admitted to the cardiac telemetry unit averaged 5.3
              hours (median 3.1, interquartile range 1.5-6.9). Demographic and
              clinical patient characteristics were not significant predictors
              of boarding time. Measurements of bed demand from competing
              admission sources significantly predicted boarding time, with
              catheterization laboratory demand levels being the most
              influential. Hospital policy required that a telemetry bed be
              held for each electively scheduled catheterization patient, yet
              the analysis revealed that 70.4\% (95\% CI 51.2-92.5) of these
              patients did not transfer to a telemetry bed and were discharged
              home each day. Results of simulation-based analyses showed that
              moving one afternoon scheduled elective catheterization case to
              before noon resulted in a 20-minute reduction in average boarding
              time compared to a 9-minute reduction achieved by increasing
              capacity by one additional telemetry bed. CONCLUSIONS: Scheduling
              and bed management practices based on measured patient transfer

              high-acuity treatment areas often have fixed allocation of
              resources, regardless of demand. We demonstrate the utility of
              discrete-event simulation to evaluate flexible partitioning
              between low- and high-acuity ED areas to identify the best
              operational strategy for subsequent implementation. METHODS: A
              discrete-event simulation was used to model patient flow through
              a 50-bed, urban, teaching ED that handles 85,000 patient visits
              annually. The ED has historically allocated 10 beds to a fast
              track for low-acuity patients. We estimated the effect of a flex
              track policy, which involved switching up to 5 of these fast
              track beds to serving both low- and high-acuity patients, on
              patient waiting times. When the high-acuity beds were not at
              capacity, low-acuity patients were given priority access to
              flexible beds. Otherwise, high-acuity patients were given
              priority access to flexible beds. Wait times were estimated for
              patients by disposition and Emergency Severity Index score.
              RESULTS: A flex track policy using 3 flexible beds produced the
              lowest mean patient waiting time of 30.9 minutes (95\% confidence
              interval [CI] 30.6 to 31.2 minutes). The typical fast track
              approach of rigidly separating high- and low-acuity beds produced
              a mean patient wait time of 40.6 minutes (95\% CI 40.2 to 50.0
              minutes), 31\% higher than that of the 3-bed flex track. A
              completely flexible ED, in which all beds can accommodate any
              patient, produced mean wait times of 35.1 minutes (95\% CI 34.8
              to 35.4 minutes). The results from the 3-bed flex track scenario
              were robust, performing well across a range of scenarios
              involving higher and lower patient volumes and care durations.
              CONCLUSION: Using discrete-event simulation, we have shown that
              adding some flexibility into bed allocation between low and high

              producers agree to lower sodium to levels deemed feasible for
              different foods, is expected to significantly reduce sodium
              intake if expanded to a large sector of food manufacturers.
              OBJECTIVE: Given recent data on the relationship between sodium
              intake, hypertension, and associated cardiovascular disease at a
              population level, we sought to examine risks and benefits of the
              program. DESIGN: To estimate the impact of further expanding the
              initiative on hypertension, myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke
              incidence, and related mortality, given food consumption patterns
              across the United States, we developed and validated a stochastic
              microsimulation model of hypertension, MI, and stroke morbidity
              and mortality, using data from food producers on sodium reduction
              among foods, linked to 24-hour dietary recalls, blood pressure,
              and cardiovascular histories from the National Health and
              Nutrition Examination Survey. RESULTS: Expansion of the
              initiative to ensure all restaurants and manufacturers reach
              agreed-upon sodium targets would be expected to avert from 0.9 to
              3.0 MIs (a 1.6\%-5.4\% reduction) and 0.5 to 2.8 strokes (a
              1.1\%-6.2\% reduction) per 10,000 Americans per year over the
              next decade, after incorporating consumption patterns and
              variations in the effect of sodium reduction on blood pressure
              among different demographic groups. Even high levels of consumer
              addition of table salt or substitution among food categories
              would be unlikely to neutralize this benefit. However, if recent
              epidemiological associations between very low sodium and
              increased mortality are causal, then older women may be at risk
              of increased mortality from excessively low sodium intake.
              CONCLUSIONS: An expanded National Salt Reduction Initiative is
              likely to significantly reduce hypertension and
              hypertension-related cardiovascular morbidity but may be
              accompanied by potential risks to older women.",

              information on state Medicaid eligibility and costs from the

              colonoscopy are recommended to repeat the procedure in 10 years.
              OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness and costs of colonoscopy
              versus other rescreening strategies after an initial negative
              colonoscopy result. DESIGN: Microsimulation model. DATA SOURCES:
              Literature and data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
              Results program. TARGET POPULATION: Persons aged 50 years who had
              no adenomas or cancer detected on screening colonoscopy. TIME
              HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: No
              further screening or rescreening starting at age 60 years with
              colonoscopy every 10 years, annual highly sensitive guaiac fecal
              occult blood testing (HSFOBT), annual fecal immunochemical
              testing (FIT), or computed tomographic colonography (CTC) every 5
              years. OUTCOME MEASURES: Lifetime cases of colorectal cancer,
              life expectancy, and lifetime costs per 1000 persons, assuming
              either perfect or imperfect adherence. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE
              ANALYSIS: Rescreening with any method substantially reduced the
              risk for colorectal cancer compared with no further screening
              (range, 7.7 to 12.6 lifetime cases per 1000 persons [perfect
              adherence] and 17.7 to 20.9 lifetime cases per 1000 persons
              [imperfect adherence] vs. 31.3 lifetime cases per 1000 persons
              with no further screening). In both adherence scenarios, the
              differences in life-years across rescreening strategies were
              small (range, 30 893 to 30 902 life-years per 1000 persons
              [perfect adherence] vs. 30 865 to 30 869 life-years per 1000
              persons [imperfect adherence]). Rescreening with HSFOBT, FIT, or
              CTC had fewer complications and was less costly than continuing
              colonoscopy. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results were
              sensitive to test-specific adherence rates. LIMITATION: Data on
              adherence to rescreening were limited. CONCLUSION: Compared with
              the currently recommended strategy of continuing colonoscopy
              every 10 years after an initial negative examination, rescreening
              at age 60 years with annual HSFOBT, annual FIT, or CTC every 5
              years provides approximately the same benefit in life-years with
              fewer complications at a lower cost. Therefore, it is reasonable
              to use other methods to rescreen persons with negative
              colonoscopy results. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: National Cancer

              Base case analyses investigated the cost effectiveness of more
              than 1500 different screening policies using the microsimulation

              (risk of cervical cancer, previous screening, quality associated
              test characteristics, costs of testing, and prevalence of HPV).
              SETTING: Various European countries. POPULATION: Unvaccinated

              screening was the preferred primary test over the age of 30 in

              preferred only in scenarios with low costs of cytology and in
              scenarios with a high prevalence of HPV in combination with high

              management. A strategy for managing a 6-week planned service
              disruption needed to be enacted 12 weeks after the announcement,
              in late October 2014, of the closure of the Hybrid Suite
              (operating room/catheterization laboratory) for renovation, at
              The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's Cardiac Center's
              Cardiac Operative and Imaging Complex (COIC). METHODS: A
              previously developed DES was queried to determine theoretical
              system throughput capacity during the temporary disruption. On
              the basis of this analysis, a rapid improvement event (RIE) was
              enacted to address systemic challenges to meeting demand with
              diminished capacity. During the RIE, system stakeholders
              (physicians, nurses, and technicians) engaged with performance
              improvement personnel to identify potential improvements, test
              those changes in rapid succession, and then implement successful
              candidates for the disruption. RESULTS: First-case start time was
              43 minutes earlier during the period of diminished capacity.
              Turnaround time between cases was reduced by 23 minutes. Length
              of day increased by 1 hour, in accordance with simulated
              predictions. System throughput was 138 patients during the

              services. To compare how strategies to increase cardiology
              inpatient throughput can either accommodate increases in surgical
              volume or improve ED patient access. METHODS: A stochastic
              discrete event simulation was created to model patient flow
              through a cardiology inpatient system within a US, urban,
              academic hospital. The simulation used survival analysis to
              examine the relationship between anticipated increases in
              surgical volume and ED patient boarding time (ie, time interval
              from cardiology admission request to inpatient bed placement).
              RESULTS: ED patients boarded for a telemetry and cardiovascular
              intensive care unit (CVICU) bed had a mean boarding time of 5.3
              (median 3.1, interquartile range 1.5-6.9) h and 2.7 (median 1.7,
              interquartile range 0.8-3.0) h, respectively. Each 10\%
              incremental increase in surgical volume resulted in a 37 and 33

              throughput by increasing capacity and decreasing length of stay
              for specific inpatients was compared. Increasing cardiology
              capacity by one telemetry and CVICU bed or decreasing length of
              stay by 1 h resulted in a 7-9 min decrease in average boarding
              time or an 11-19\% increase in surgical patient volume
              accommodation. CONCLUSIONS: Simulating competition dynamics for
              hospital admissions provides prospective planning (ie, decision
              making) information and demonstrates how interventions to
              increase inpatient throughput will have a much greater effect on

              Frequent screening for syphilis and treatment of men who test
              positive might be a practical means of controlling the risk of
              infection and disease sequelae in this population. PURPOSE: We
              evaluated the cost-effectiveness of strategies that increased the
              frequency and population coverage of syphilis screening in
              HIV-infected MSM receiving HIV care, relative to current standard
              of care. METHODS: We developed a state-transition microsimulation
              model of syphilis natural history and medical care in
              HIV-infected MSM receiving care for HIV. We performed Monte Carlo
              simulations using input data derived from a large observational
              cohort in Ontario, Canada, and from published biomedical
              literature. Simulations compared usual care (57\% of the
              population screened annually) to different combinations of more
              frequent (3- or 6-monthly) screening and higher coverage (100\%
              screened). We estimated expected disease-specific outcomes,
              quality-adjusted survival, costs, and cost-effectiveness
              associated with each strategy from the perspective of a public
              health care payer. RESULTS: Usual care was more costly and less
              effective than strategies with more frequent or higher coverage
              screening. Higher coverage strategies (with screening frequency
              of 3 or 6 months) were expected to be cost-effective based on
              usually cited willingness-to-pay thresholds. These findings were
              robust in the face of probabilistic sensitivity analyses,
              alternate cost-effectiveness thresholds, and alternate
              assumptions about duration of risk, program characteristics, and
              management of underlying HIV. CONCLUSIONS: We project that higher
              coverage and more frequent syphilis screening of HIV-infected MSM
              would be a highly cost-effective health intervention, with many
              potentially viable screening strategies projected to both save
              costs and improve health when compared to usual care. The

              comparing a waiting list prioritization system with the routinely
              used first-in, first-out (FIFO) discipline. METHODS: The setting
              was the Spanish health system. The model reproduced the process
              of cataract, from incidence of need of surgery (meeting
              indication criteria), through demand, inclusion on a waiting
              list, and surgery. ``Nonexpressed Need'' represented the
              population that, even with need, would not be included on a
              waiting list. Parameters were estimated from administrative data
              and research databases. The impact of introducing a
              prioritization system on the waiting list compared with the FIFO
              system was assessed. For all patients entering the waiting list,
              the main outcome variable was waiting time weighted by priority
              score. A sensitivity analysis with different scenarios of mean
              waiting time was used to compare the two alternatives. RESULTS:
              The prioritization system shortened waiting time (weighted by
              priority score) by 1.55 months (95\% CI: 1.47 to 1.62) compared
              with the FIFO system. This difference was statistically
              significant for all scenarios (which were defined from a waiting
              time of 4 months to 24 months under the FIFO system). A tendency
              to greater time savings in scenarios with longer waiting times
              was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Discrete-event simulation is useful in
              decision-making when assessing health services. Introducing a
              waiting list prioritization system produced greater benefit than
              allocating surgery by waiting time only. Use of the simulation
              model would allow the impact of proposed policies to reduce
              waiting lists or assign resources more efficiently to be tested.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Computer simulation studies of the emergency
              department (ED) are often patient driven and consider the
              physician as a human resource whose primary activity is
              interacting directly with the patient. In many EDs, physicians
              supervise delegates such as residents, physician assistants and
              nurse practitioners each with different skill sets and levels of
              independence. The purpose of this study is to present an
              alternative approach where physicians and their delegates in the
              ED are modeled as interacting pseudo-agents in a discrete event
              simulation (DES) and to compare it with the traditional approach
              ignoring such interactions. METHODS: The new approach models a
              hierarchy of heterogeneous interacting pseudo-agents in a DES,
              where pseudo-agents are entities with embedded decision logic.
              The pseudo-agents represent a physician and delegate, where the
              physician plays a senior role to the delegate (i.e. treats high
              acuity patients and acts as a consult for the delegate). A simple
              model without the complexity of the ED is first created in order
              to validate the building blocks (programming) used to create the
              pseudo-agents and their interaction (i.e. consultation).
              Following validation, the new approach is implemented in an ED
              model using data from an Ontario hospital. Outputs from this
              model are compared with outputs from the ED model without the
              interacting pseudo-agents. They are compared based on physician
              and delegate utilization, patient waiting time for treatment, and
              average length of stay. Additionally, we conduct sensitivity
              analyses on key parameters in the model. RESULTS: In the hospital
              ED model, comparisons between the approach with interaction and
              without showed physician utilization increase from 23\% to 41\%
              and delegate utilization increase from 56\% to 71\%. Results show
              statistically significant mean time differences for low acuity
              patients between models. Interaction time between physician and
              delegate results in increased ED length of stay and longer waits
              for beds. CONCLUSION: This example shows the importance of
              accurately modeling physician relationships and the roles in
              which they treat patients. Neglecting these relationships could
              lead to inefficient resource allocation due to inaccurate
              estimates of physician and delegate time spent on patient related
              activities and length of stay.",

              denies payment for venous thromboembolism (VTE) after total knee
              arthroplasty (TKA). The intention is to reduce complications and
              associated costs, while improving the quality of care by
              mandating VTE prophylaxis. We applied a system dynamics model to
              estimate the impact of HACS on VTE rates, and potential
              unintended consequences such as increased rates of bleeding and
              infection and decreased access for patients who might benefit
              from TKA. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The system dynamics model uses a
              series of patient stocks including the number needing TKA, deemed
              ineligible, receiving TKA, and harmed due to surgical
              complication. The flow of patients between stocks is determined
              by a series of causal elements such as rates of exclusion,
              surgery and complications. The number of patients harmed due to
              VTE, bleeding or exclusion were modeled by year by comparing
              patient stocks that results in scenarios with and without HACS.
              The percentage of TKA patients experiencing VTE decreased
              approximately 3-fold with HACS. This decrease in VTE was offset
              by an increased rate of bleeding and infection. Moreover, results
              from the model suggest HACS could exclude 1.5\% or half a million
              patients who might benefit from knee replacement through 2020.
              CONCLUSION: System dynamics modeling indicates HACS will have the
              intended consequence of reducing VTE rates. However, an
              unintended consequence of the policy might be increased potential
              harm resulting from over administration of prophylaxis, as well
              as exclusion of a large population of patients who might benefit
              from TKA.",

              since 2003, it is still administered only to a small percentage
              of eligible patients. AIM: We consider the impact of investing
              the impact of thrombolysis on important acute stroke services,
              and the effect on quality of life. The concept is illustrated
              using data from the Northern Ireland Stroke Service. DESIGN:
              Retrospective study. METHODS: We first present results of
              survival analysis utilizing length of stay (LOS) for discharge
              destinations, based on data from the Belfast City Hospital (BCH).
              None of these patients actually received thrombolysis but from
              those who would have been eligible, we created two initial
              groups, the first representing a scenario where they received
              thrombolysis and the second comprising those who do not receive
              thrombolysis. On the basis of the survival analysis, we created
              several subgroups based on discharge destination. We then
              developed a discrete event simulation (DES) model, where each
              group is a patient pathway within the simulation. Coxian phase
              type distributions were used to model the group LOS. Various
              scenarios were explored focusing on cost-effectiveness across
              hospital, community and social services had thrombolysis been
              administered to these patients, and the possible improvement in
              quality of life, should the proportion of patients who are
              administered thrombolysis be increased. Our aim in simulating
              various scenarios for this historical group of patients is to
              assess what the cost-effectiveness of thrombolysis would have
              been under different scenarios; from this we can infer the likely
              cost-effectiveness of future policies. RESULTS: The cost of
              thrombolysis is offset by reduction in hospital, community
              rehabilitation and institutional care costs, with a corresponding
              improvement in quality of life. CONCLUSION: Our model suggests
              that provision of thrombolysis would produce moderate overall
              improvement to the service assuming current levels of funding.",

              universal screening with alternative feasible strategies. DESIGN:
              Microsimulation study of a close-to-reality synthetic population.
              Five scenarios were considered: baseline scenario, assuming that
              current trends in risk factors will continue in the future;
              universal screening; screening concentrated only in the most
              deprived areas; structural population-wide intervention; and
              combination of population-wide intervention and concentrated
              screening. SETTING: Synthetic population with similar
              characteristics to the community dwelling population of England.
              PARTICIPANTS: Synthetic people with traits informed by the health
              survey for England. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Cardiovascular disease
              cases and deaths prevented or postponed by 2030, stratified by
              fifths of socioeconomic status using the index of multiple
              deprivation. RESULTS: Compared with the baseline scenario,
              universal screening may prevent or postpone approximately 19 000
              cases (interquartile range 11 000-28 000) and 3000 deaths
              (-1000-6000); concentrated screening 17 000 cases (9000-26 000)
              and 2000 deaths (-1000-5000); population-wide intervention 67 000
              cases (57 000-77 000) and 8000 deaths (4000-11 000); and the
              combination of the population-wide intervention and concentrated
              screening 82 000 cases (73 000-93 000) and 9000 deaths (6000-13
              000). The most equitable strategy would be the combination of the
              population-wide intervention and concentrated screening, followed
              by concentrated screening alone and the population-wide
              intervention. Universal screening had the least apparent impact
              on socioeconomic inequalities in health. CONCLUSIONS: When
              primary prevention strategies for reducing cardiovascular disease
              burden and inequalities are compared, universal screening seems
              less effective than alternative strategies, which incorporate
              population-wide approaches. Further research is needed to
              identify the best mix of population-wide and risk targeted CVD
              strategies to maximise cost effectiveness and minimise
              inequalities.",

              U.S., especially among racial/ethnic minorities and low-income
              populations. Federal policy is important in improving public
              health given its broad reach. Information is needed about federal
              policies that could reduce childhood obesity rates and by how
              much. PURPOSE: To estimate the impact of three federal policies
              on childhood obesity prevalence in 2032, after 20 years of
              implementation. METHODS: Criteria were used to select the three
              following policies to reduce childhood obesity from 26
              recommended policies: afterschool physical activity programs, a
              $0.01/ounce sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) excise tax, and a ban
              on child-directed fast food TV advertising. For each policy, the
              literature was reviewed from January 2000 through July 2012 to
              find evidence of effectiveness and create average effect sizes.
              In 2012, a Markov microsimulation model estimated each policy's
              impact on diet or physical activity, and then BMI, in a simulated
              school-aged population in 2032. RESULTS: The microsimulation
              predicted that afterschool physical activity programs would
              reduce obesity the most among children aged 6-12 years (1.8
              percentage points) and the advertising ban would reduce obesity
              the least (0.9 percentage points). The SSB excise tax would
              reduce obesity the most among adolescents aged 13-18 years (2.4
              percentage points). All three policies would reduce obesity more
              among blacks and Hispanics than whites, with the SSB excise tax
              reducing obesity disparities the most. CONCLUSIONS: All three
              policies would reduce childhood obesity prevalence by 2032.

              length of stay and cost. However, research on how adverse events
              affect patient flow and operational performance has been
              relatively limited to date. Moreover, there is paucity of studies
              on the use of simulation in understanding the effect of
              complications on care processes and resources. In hospitals with
              scarcity of resources, postoperative complications can exert a
              substantial influence on hospital throughputs. METHODS: This
              paper describes an evaluation method for assessing the effect of
              complications on patient flow within a cardiac surgical
              department. The method is illustrated by a case study where
              actual patient-level data are incorporated into a discrete event
              simulation (DES) model. The DES model uses patient data obtained
              from a large hospital in Oman to quantify the effect of
              complications on patient flow, costs and surgical throughputs. We
              evaluated the incremental increase in resources due to treatment
              of complications using Poisson regression. Several types of
              complications were examined such as cardiac complications,
              pulmonary complications, infection complications and neurological
              complications. RESULTS: 48 \% of the patients in our dataset
              experienced one or more complications. The most common types of
              complications were ventricular arrhythmia (16 \%) followed by new
              atrial arrhythmia (15.5 \%) and prolonged ventilation longer than
              24 h (12.5 \%). The total number of additional days associated
              with infections was the highest, while cardiac complications have
              resulted in the lowest number of incremental days of hospital
              stay. Complications had a significant effect on perioperative
              operational performance such as surgery cancellations and waiting
              time. The effect was profound when complications occurred in the
              Cardiac Intensive Care (CICU) where a limited capacity was
              observed. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides evidence supporting the

              (PD) is increasing in the United Kingdom driven by population
              ageing. The treatment of the disease is complex, resource
              intensive and currently there is no known cure to PD. The
              National Health Service (NHS), the public organisation delivering
              healthcare in the UK, is under financial pressures. There is a
              need to find innovative ways to improve the operational and
              financial performance of treating PD patients. The use of
              community services is a new and promising way of providing
              treatment and care to PD patients at reduced cost than hospital
              care. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential
              operational and financial benefits, which could be achieved
              through increased integration of community services in the
              delivery of treatment and care to PD patients in the UK without
              compromising care quality. METHODS: A Discrete Event Simulation
              model was developed to represent the PD care structure including
              patients' pathways, treatment modes, and the mix of resources
              required to treat PD patients. The model was parametrised with
              data from a large NHS Trust in the UK and validated using
              information from the same trust. Four possible scenarios
              involving increased use of community services were simulated on
              the model. RESULTS: Shifting more patients with PD from hospital
              treatment to community services will reduce the number of visits
              of PD patients to hospitals by about 25\% and the number of PD
              doctors and nurses required to treat these patients by around
              32\%. Hospital based treatment costs overall should decrease by
              26\% leading to overall savings of 10\% in the total cost of
              treating PD patients. CONCLUSIONS: The simulation model was
              useful in predicting the effects of increased use of community
              services on the performance of PD care delivery. Treatment
              policies need to reflect upon and formalise the use of community
              services and integrate these better in PD care. The advantages of
              community services need to be effectively shared with PD patients
              and carers to help inform management choices and care plans.",

              mortality from chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease
              (CVD) by 25\% by 2025. High blood pressure is a leading CVD risk
              factor. We sought to compare 3 strategies for treating blood
              pressure in China and India: a treat-to-target (TTT) strategy
              emphasizing lowering blood pressure to a target, a benefit-based
              tailored treatment (BTT) strategy emphasizing lowering CVD risk,
              or a hybrid strategy currently recommended by the World Health
              Organization. METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed a microsimulation
              model of adults aged 30 to 70 years in China and in India to
              compare the 2 treatment approaches across a 10-year
              policy-planning horizon. In the model, a BTT strategy treating
              adults with a 10-year CVD event risk of $\geq$ 10\% used similar
              financial resources but averted $\approx$ 5 million more
              disability-adjusted life-years in both China and India than a TTT
              approach based on current US guidelines. The hybrid strategy in
              the current World Health Organization guidelines produced no
              substantial benefits over TTT. BTT was more cost-effective at
              $205 to $272/disability-adjusted life-year averted, which was
              $142 to $182 less per disability-adjusted life-year than TTT or
              hybrid strategies. The comparative effectiveness of BTT was
              robust to uncertainties in CVD risk estimation and to variations
              in the age range analyzed, the BTT treatment threshold, or rates
              of treatment access, adherence, or concurrent statin therapy.

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: The objective was to derive and validate a novel
              queuing theory-based model that predicts the effect of various
              patient crowding scenarios on patient left without being seen
              (LWBS) rates. METHODS: Retrospective data were collected from all
              patient presentations to triage at an urban, academic, adult-only
              emergency department (ED) with 87,705 visits in calendar year
              2008. Data from specific time windows during the day were divided
              into derivation and validation sets based on odd or even days.
              Patient records with incomplete time data were excluded. With an
              established call center queueing model, input variables were
              modified to adapt this model to the ED setting, while satisfying
              the underlying assumptions of queueing theory. The primary aim
              was the derivation and validation of an ED flow model. Chi-square
              and Student's t-tests were used for model derivation and
              validation. The secondary aim was estimating the effect of
              varying ED patient arrival and boarding scenarios on LWBS rates
              using this model. RESULTS: The assumption of stationarity of the
              model was validated for three time periods (peak arrival rate =
              10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.; a moderate arrival rate = 8:00 a.m. to
              10:00 a.m.; and lowest arrival rate = 4:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.) and
              for different days of the week and month. Between 10:00 a.m. and
              12:00 p.m., defined as the primary study period representing peak
              arrivals, 3.9\% (n = 4,038) of patients LWBS. Using the derived
              model, the predicted LWBS rate was 4\%. LWBS rates increased as
              the rate of ED patient arrivals, treatment times, and ED boarding
              times increased. A 10\% increase in hourly ED patient arrivals
              from the observed average arrival rate increased the predicted
              LWBS rate to 10.8\%; a 10\% decrease in hourly ED patient
              arrivals from the observed average arrival rate predicted a 1.6\%
              LWBS rate. A 30-minute decrease in treatment time from the
              observed average treatment time predicted a 1.4\% LWBS. A 1\%
              increase in patient arrivals has the same effect on LWBS rates as
              a 1\% increase in treatment time. Reducing boarding times by 10\%
              is expected to reduce LWBS rates by approximately 0.8\%.
              CONCLUSIONS: This novel queuing theory-based model predicts the
              effect of patient arrivals, treatment time, and ED boarding on
              the rate of patients who LWBS at one institution. More studies

              arrival rates in an emergency department (ED) to determine the
              appropriate number of shift schedules in an acute care area and a
              fast-track clinic and 2) to determine whether physician
              scheduling can be improved by aligning physician productivity
              with patient arrivals using an optimization planning model.
              METHODS: Historical data were statistically analyzed to determine
              whether the number of patients arriving at the ED varied by
              weekday, weekend, or holiday weekend. Poisson-based generalized
              additive models were used to develop models of patient arrival
              rate throughout the day. A mathematical programming model was
              used to produce an optimal ED shift schedule for the estimated
              patient arrival rates. We compared the current physician schedule
              to three other scheduling scenarios: 1) a revised schedule
              produced by the planning model, 2) the revised schedule with an
              additional acute care physician, and 3) the revised schedule with
              an additional fast-track clinic physician. RESULTS: Statistical
              modelling found that patient arrival rates were different for
              acute care versus fast-track clinics; the patterns in arrivals
              followed essentially the same daily pattern in the acute care
              area; and arrival patterns differed on weekdays versus weekends
              in the fast-track clinic. The planning model reduced the unmet
              patient demand (i.e., the average number of patients arriving at
              the ED beyond the average physician productivity) by 19\%, 39\%,
              and 69\% for the three scenarios examined. CONCLUSIONS: The

              effects of an intervention on a health care system, we presented
              the System, Interactions, Multilevel, Understanding, Loops,

              elements. This report builds on the previous work, systematically
              comparing each of the three most commonly used dynamic simulation
              modeling methods-system dynamics, discrete-event simulation, and
              agent-based modeling. We review criteria for selecting the most
              suitable method depending on 1) the purpose-type of problem and
              research questions being investigated, 2) the object-scope of the

              design through model maintenance and upkeep. We conclude by

              death, is preventable with colonoscopic screening. Colonoscopy
              cost is high, and optimizing resource utilization for colonoscopy
              is important. This study's aim is to evaluate resource allocation
              for optimal use of facilities for colonoscopy screening. METHOD:
              The authors used data from a computerized colonoscopy database to
              develop a discrete event simulation model of a colonoscopy suite.
              Operational configurations were compared by varying the number of
              endoscopists, procedure rooms, the patient arrival times, and
              procedure room turnaround time. Performance measures included the
              number of patients served during the clinic day and utilization
              of key resources. Further analysis included considering patient
              waiting time tradeoffs as well as the sensitivity of the system
              to procedure room turnaround time. RESULTS: The maximum number of
              patients served is linearly related to the number of procedure
              rooms in the colonoscopy suite, with a fixed room to endoscopist
              ratio. Utilization of intake and recovery resources becomes more
              efficient as the number of procedure rooms increases, indicating
              the potential benefits of large colonoscopy suites. Procedure
              room turnaround time has a significant influence on patient
              throughput, procedure room utilization, and endoscopist
              utilization for varying ratios between 1:1 and 2:1 rooms per
              endoscopist. Finally, changes in the patient arrival schedule can
              reduce patient waiting time while not requiring a longer clinic
              day. CONCLUSIONS: Suite managers should keep a procedure room to
              endoscopist ratio between 1:1 and 2:1 while considering the
              utilization of related key resources as a decision factor as
              well. The sensitivity of the system to processes such as

              constructed a discrete-event simulation model to study the
              dynamics of patient mixes with realistic treatment plans, and to
              estimate the practical capacity of the physical therapy room. The

  abstract = "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic lung
              disease that is thought to affect over one million people in
              Great Britain. The main factor contributing to the development of
              COPD is tobacco smoke. This paper presents a microsimulation
              model for the development of COPD, incorporating population
              dynamics and trends in smoking. The model simulates a population
              longitudinally throughout their lifetimes, providing projections
              of future COPD prevalence and evaluation of the effects of
              changes in risk factor prevalence such as smoking. Sensitivity
              analysis provides information on the most influential model
              parameters. The model-predicted prevalence of COPD in 2040 was
              17\% in males over the age of 35 years (13\% amongst non-smokers
              and 22\% amongst smokers), and a modest decline over the next 25
              years due to recent trends in smoking rates. The simulation model
              provides us with valuable information on current and future
              trends in COPD in Great Britain. It was developed primarily to
              enable easy extension to evaluate the effects of occupational and
              environmental exposures on lung function and the prevalence of
              COPD and to allow evaluation of interventions, such as
              introducing health surveillance or policy changes. As
              longitudinal studies for investigating COPD are difficult due to
              the lengthy follow-up time required and the potentially large
              number of drop-outs, we anticipate that the model will provide a
              valuable tool for health impact assessment. An extended model for
              occupational exposures is under development and will be presented
              in a subsequent paper.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Decision-analytic models are routinely used as a
              framework for cost-effectiveness analyses of health care services
              and technologies; however, these models mostly ignore resource
              constraints. In this study, we use a discrete-event simulation
              model to inform a cost-effectiveness analysis of alternative
              options for the organization and delivery of clinical services in
              the ophthalmology department of a public hospital. The model is
              novel, given that it represents both disease outcomes and
              resource constraints in a routine clinical setting. METHODS: A
              5-year discrete-event simulation model representing glaucoma
              patient services at the Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH) was
              implemented and calibrated to patient-level data. The data were
              sourced from routinely collected waiting and appointment lists,
              patient record data, and the published literature. Patient-level
              costs and quality-adjusted life years were estimated for a range
              of alternative scenarios, including combinations of alternate
              follow-up times, booking cycles, and treatment pathways. RESULTS:
              The model shows that a) extending booking cycle length from 4 to
              6 months, b) extending follow-up visit times by 2 to 3 months,
              and c) using laser in preference to medication are more
              cost-effective than current practice at the RAH eye clinic.
              CONCLUSIONS: The current simulation model provides a useful tool
              for informing improvements in the organization and delivery of
              glaucoma services at a local level (e.g., within a hospital), on
              the basis of expected effects on costs and health outcomes while
              accounting for current capacity constraints. Our model may be
              adapted to represent glaucoma services at other hospitals,
              whereas the general modeling approach could be applied to many
              other clinical service areas.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Explore whether agent-based modeling and simulation can
              help healthcare administrators discover interventions that
              increase population wellness and quality of care while,
              simultaneously, decreasing costs. Since important dynamics often
              lie in the social determinants outside the health facilities that
              provide services, this study thus models the problem at three
              levels (individuals, organizations, and society). METHODS: The
              study explores the utility of translating an existing (prize
              winning) software for modeling complex societal systems and
              agent's daily life activities (like a Sim City style of
              software), into a desired decision support system. A case study
              tests if the 3 levels of system modeling approach is feasible,
              valid, and useful. The case study involves an urban population
              with serious mental health and Philadelphia's Medicaid population
              (n=527,056), in particular. RESULTS: Section 3 explains the
              models using data from the case study and thereby establishes
              feasibility of the approach for modeling a real system. The
              models were trained and tuned using national epidemiologic
              datasets and various domain expert inputs. To avoid co-mingling
              of training and testing data, the simulations were then run and
              compared (Section 4.1) to an analysis of 250,000 Philadelphia
              patient hospital admissions for the year 2010 in terms of
              re-hospitalization rate, number of doctor visits, and days in
              hospital. Based on the Student t-test, deviations between
              simulated vs. real world outcomes are not statistically
              significant. Validity is thus established for the 2008-2010
              timeframe. We computed models of various types of interventions
              that were ineffective as well as 4 categories of interventions
              (e.g., reduced per-nurse caseload, increased check-ins and stays,
              etc.) that result in improvement in well-being and cost.
              CONCLUSIONS: The 3 level approach appears to be useful to help
              health administrators sort through system complexities to find
              effective interventions at lower costs.",

              inpatient discharge time targets to help hospitals reduce
              crowding, improve patient flow through the ED and balance staff
              workload. METHODS: Fifteen months of emergency and inpatient
              records from a large quaternary teaching hospital were used to
              reconstruct patient pathways from hospital presentation to
              discharge. Discrete event simulation was used to assess
              operationally realistic discharge scenarios on flow performance.
              Main output measures included National Emergency Access Target
              (NEAT) performance (an ED performance metric), time spent waiting
              for a bed, hospital length of stay (LOS) and occupancy. RESULTS:
              Similar levels of improvement in NEAT performance (16\%), and
              reductions in average bed occupancy (1.5\%) and inpatient bed
              wait time (25\%) were observed across the simulation that
              discharged 80\% patients before 11 a.m. and one that spread the
              target between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Individual inpatient wards
              returned potential improvements in NEAT performance (median 10\%,
              interquartile range (IQR) 7\%), and reductions in hospital LOS
              (median 1\%, IQR 1\%) and average occupancy (median 1\%, IQR 2\%)
              across the discharge scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Conventional
              discharge targets like '80\% by 11 a.m.' and others that spread
              targets across the day to balance staff workload freed up the
              equivalent of nine available beds for incoming patient flow,
              significantly reducing time spent waiting for an inpatient bed,
              hospital LOS and occupancy, and delivering much needed
              improvements in NEAT performance. While different strategies and
              workload distributions may suit individual hospital services, the
              study makes a strong case for improving 'early in the day'
              discharge timeliness to deliver better ED flow.",

              model-based estimates and projections on current and future
              health and economic impacts of multiple sclerosis (MS) in Canada
              over a 20-year time horizon (2011-2031). METHODS: Using
              Statistics Canada's Population Health Microsimulation Model
              (POHEM) framework, specifically the population-based
              longitudinal, microsimulation model named POHEM-Neurological, we
              identified people with MS from health administrative data sources
              and derived incidence and mortality rate parameters from a
              British Columbia population-based cohort for future MS incidence
              and mortality projections. We also included a utility-based
              measure (Health Utilities Index Mark 3) reflecting states of
              functional health to allow projections of health-related quality
              of life. Finally, we estimated caregiving parameters and health
              care costs from Canadian national surveys and health
              administrative data and included them as model parameters to
              assess the health and economic impact of the neurological
              conditions. RESULTS: The number of incident MS cases is expected
              to rise slightly from 4051 cases in 2011 to 4794 cases per 100
              000 population in 2031, and the number of Canadians affected by
              MS will increase from 98 385 in 2011 to 133 635 in 2031. The
              total per capita health care cost (excluding out-of-pocket
              expenses) for adults aged 20 and older in 2011 was about $16 800
              for individuals with MS, and approximately $2500 for individuals
              without a neurological condition. Thus, after accounting for
              additional expenditures due to MS (excluding out-of-pocket
              expenses), total annual health sector costs for MS are expected
              to reach $2.0 billion by 2031. As well, the average out-of-pocket
              expenditure for people with MS was around $1300 annually
              throughout the projection period. CONCLUSION: MS is associated
              with a significant economic burden on society, since it usually
              affects young adults during prime career- and family-building
              years. Canada has a particularly high prevalence of MS, so
              research such as the present study is essential to provide a
              better understanding of the current and future negative impacts
              of MS on the Canadian population, so that health care system
              policymakers can best plan how to meet the needs of patients who
              are affected by MS. These findings also suggest that identifying
              strategies to prevent MS and more effectively treat the disease
              are needed to mitigate these future impacts.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Smoking cessation medications have been shown to
              yield higher success rates and sustained abstinence than
              unassisted quit attempts. In Japan, the treatments available
              include nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and varenicline;
              however, unassisted attempts to quit smoking remain common.
              OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the health
              and economic consequences in Japan of using pharmacotherapy to
              support smoking cessation with unassisted attempts and the
              current mix of strategies used. METHODS: A discrete-event
              simulation that models lifetime quitting behaviour and includes
              multiple quit attempts (MQAs) and relapses was adapted for these
              analyses. The risk of developing smoking-related diseases is
              estimated based on the duration of abstinence. Data collected
              from a survey conducted in Japan were used to determine the
              interventions selected by smokers initiating a quit attempt and
              the time between MQAs. Direct and indirect costs are assessed
              (expressed in 2014 Japanese Yen). RESULTS: Using pharmacotherapy
              (NRT or varenicline) to support quit attempts proved to be
              dominant when compared with unassisted attempts or the current
              mix of strategies (most are unassisted). The results of
              stratified analyses by age imply that smoking cessation improves
              health outcomes across all generations. Indirect costs due to
              premature death leading to lost wages are an important component
              of the total costs, exceeding the direct medical cost estimates.
              CONCLUSIONS: Increased utilisation of smoking cessation
              pharmacotherapy to support quit attempts is predicted to lead to
              an increase in the number of smokers achieving abstinence, and
              provide improvements in health outcomes over a lifetime with no
              additional costs.",

              measured by adenoma detection rates (ADRs), varies widely among

              benefits, complications, and costs of an initial colonoscopy
              screening program at different levels of adenoma detection.
              DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Microsimulation modeling with
              data from a community-based health care system on ADR variation
              and cancer risk among 57,588 patients examined by 136 physicians
              from 1998 through 2010. EXPOSURES: Using modeling, no screening
              was compared with screening initiation with colonoscopy according
              to ADR quintiles (averages 15.3\%, quintile 1; 21.3\%, quintile
              2; 25.6\%, quintile 3; 30.9\%, quintile 4; and 38.7\%, quintile
              5) at ages 50, 60, and 70 years with appropriate surveillance of
              patients with adenoma. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Estimated
              lifetime colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, number of
              colonoscopies, complications, and costs per 1000 patients, all
              discounted at 3\% per year and including 95\% confidence
              intervals from multiway probabilistic sensitivity analysis.
              RESULTS: In simulation modeling, among unscreened patients the
              lifetime risk of colorectal cancer incidence was 34.2 per 1000
              (95\% CI, 25.9-43.6) and risk of mortality was 13.4 per 1000
              (95\% CI, 10.0-17.6). Among screened patients, simulated lifetime
              incidence decreased with lower to higher ADRs (26.6; 95\% CI,
              20.0-34.3 for quintile 1 vs 12.5; 95\% CI, 9.3-16.5 for quintile
              5) as did mortality (5.7; 95\% CI, 4.2-7.7 for quintile 1 vs 2.3;
              95\% CI, 1.7-3.1 for quintile 5). Compared with quintile 1,
              simulated lifetime incidence was on average 11.4\% (95\% CI,
              10.3\%-11.9\%) lower for every 5 percentage-point increase of
              ADRs and for mortality, 12.8\% (95\% CI, 11.1\%-13.7\%) lower.
              Complications increased from 6.0 (95\% CI, 4.0-8.5) of 2777
              colonoscopies (95\% CI, 2626-2943) in quintile 1 to 8.9 (95\% CI,

              colonoscopies in quintile 5. Estimated net screening costs were
              lower from quintile 1 (US $2.1 million, 95\% CI, $1.8-$2.4
              million) to quintile 5 (US $1.8 million, 95\% CI, $1.3-$2.3

              using a population-based health microsimulation model of
              osteoarthritis (POHEM-OA). METHODS: We used administrative health
              data from the province of British Columbia (BC), Canada, a survey
              of a random sample of BC residents diagnosed with OA (Ministry of
              Health of BC data), Canadian Institute of Health Information
              (CIHI) cost data and literature estimates to populate a
              microsimulation model. Cost components associated with
              pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments, total joint
              replacement (TJR) surgery, as well as use of hospital resources
              and management of complications arising from the treatment of

              simulated using the POHEM-OA model to construct profiles for each
              adult Canadian. RESULTS: From 2010 to 2031, as the prevalence of
              OA is projected to increase from 13.8\% to 18.6\%, the total
              direct cost of OA is projected to increase from \$2.9 billion to
              \$7.6 billion, an almost 2.6-fold increase (in 2010 \$CAD). From
              the highest to the lowest, the cost components that will
              constitute the total direct cost of OA in 2031 are
              hospitalization cost (\$2.9 billion), outpatient services (\$1.2

              admission decision is made by the team of providers (attending
              physicians, residents, physician extenders) (type 1) or attending

              (type 3), or attending physicians (type 4) in the ED. We
              developed discrete-event simulation models of patient flow to

              effective in reducing the length of stay of admitted patients by
              14\% to 26\%. In other words, patients may spend 1.4 to 2.5 hours

  abstract = "The number of emergency cases or emergency room visits rapidly
              increases annually, thus leading to an imbalance in supply and
              demand and to the long-term overcrowding of hospital emergency
              departments (EDs). However, current solutions to increase medical
              resources and improve the handling of patient needs are either
              impractical or infeasible in the Taiwanese environment.
              Therefore, EDs must optimize resource allocation given limited
              medical resources to minimize the average length of stay of
              patients and medical resource waste costs. This study constructs
              a multi-objective mathematical model for medical resource
              allocation in EDs in accordance with emergency flow or procedure.
              The proposed mathematical model is complex and difficult to solve
              because its performance value is stochastic; furthermore, the
              model considers both objectives simultaneously. Thus, this study
              develops a multi-objective simulation optimization algorithm by
              integrating a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA
              II) with multi-objective computing budget allocation (MOCBA) to
              address the challenges of multi-objective medical resource
              allocation. NSGA II is used to investigate plausible solutions
              for medical resource allocation, and MOCBA identifies effective
              sets of feasible Pareto (non-dominated) medical resource
              allocation solutions in addition to effectively allocating
              simulation or computation budgets. The discrete event simulation
              model of ED flow is inspired by a Taiwan hospital case and is
              constructed to estimate the expected performance values of each
              medical allocation solution as obtained through NSGA II. Finally,
              computational experiments are performed to verify the
              effectiveness and performance of the integrated NSGA II and MOCBA

              point of referral to a radiation oncologist to the start of
              radiotherapy, considering the sequential steps and resources of

              reduced the mean RTTT by 6.55\%, leading to 84.92\% of patients
              being treated within the 14 calendar day target. Adding one more

              of symptoms of a stroke has been shown to be a cost-effective
              treatment because treated patients are 30\% more likely than
              nontreated patients to have no residual disability. The objective
              of this study was to calculate by means of a discrete event
              simulation model the budget impact of thrombolysis in Spain.
              METHODS: The budget impact analysis was based on stroke incidence
              rates and the estimation of the prevalence of stroke-related
              disability in Spain and its translation to hospital and social
              costs. A discrete event simulation model was constructed to
              represent the flow of patients with stroke in Spain. RESULTS: If
              10\% of patients with stroke from 2000 to 2015 would receive
              thrombolytic treatment, the prevalence of dependent patients in
              2015 would decrease from 149,953 to 145,922. For the first 6
              years, the cost of intervention would surpass the savings.
              Nevertheless, the number of cases in which patient dependency was
              avoided would steadily increase, and after 2006 the cost savings
              would be greater, with a widening difference between the cost of
              intervention and the cost of nonintervention, until 2015.
              CONCLUSION: The impact of thrombolysis on society's health and
              social budget indicates a net benefit after 6 years, and the
              improvement in health grows continuously. The validation of the

              alive without progression, local recurrence, metastasis, and
              death. Individual patients were simulated by repeatedly sampling
              a patient profile, consisting of patient and tumor
              characteristics. The transitioning of patients between the health
              states is governed by personalized time-dependent hazard rates,
              which were obtained from multistate statistical modeling (MSSM).
              The model simulations for both the individualized and

              primarily with physicians in a three-year Family Medicine
              residency program at The University of Texas School of Medicine

              investigate changes to current scheduling rules and operating
              procedures. Discrete event simulation was used to establish a
              baseline and to evaluate a variety of scenarios associated with
              appointment scheduling and managing early and late arrivals. The
              first steps in developing the model were to map the
              administrative and diagnostic processes and to collect
              time-stamped data and fit probability distributions to each. In
              conjunction with the initialization and validation steps, various
              regressions were performed to determine if any relationships
              existed between individual providers and patient types, length of
              stay, and the difference between discharge time and appointment
              time. The latter two statistics along with resource utilization
              and closing time were the primary metrics used to evaluate system
              performance.The results showed that up to an 8.5 \% reduction in
              patient length of stay is achievable without noticeably affecting
              the other metrics by carefully adjusting appointment times.
              Reducing the no-show rate from its current value of 21.8 \% or
              overbooking, however, is likely to overwhelm the system's
              resources and lead to excessive congestion and overtime. Another
              major finding was that the providers are the limiting factor in
              improving patient flow. With an average utilization rate above 90
              \% there is little prospect in shortening the total patient time
              in the clinic without reducing the providers' average assessment
              time. Finally, several suggestions are offered to ensure fairness

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Transfusion of allogeneic blood is still common in
              orthopedic surgery. This analysis evaluates from the perspective
              of a German hospital the potential cost savings of Epoetin alfa
              (EPO) compared to predonated autologous blood transfusions or to
              a nobloodconservationstrategy (allogeneic blood transfusion
              strategy)during elective hip and knee replacement surgery.
              METHODS: Individual patients (N = 50,000) were simulated based on
              data from controlled trials, the German DRG institute (InEK) and
              various publications and entered into a stochastic model
              (Monte-Carlo) of three treatment arms: EPO, preoperative
              autologous donation and nobloodconservationstrategy. All three
              strategies lead to a different risk for an allogeneic blood
              transfusion. The model focused on the costs and events of the
              three different procedures. The costs were obtained from clinical
              trial databases, the German DRG system, patient records and
              medical publications: transfusion (allogeneic red blood cells:
              €320/unit and autologous red blood cells: €250/unit), pneumonia
              treatment (€5,000), and length of stay (€300/day). Probabilistic
              sensitivity analyses were performed to determine which factors
              had an influence on the model's clinical and cost outcomes.
              RESULTS: At acquisition costs of €200/40,000 IU EPO is cost
              saving compared to autologous blood donation, and cost-effective
              compared to a nobloodconservationstrategy. The results were most
              sensitive to the cost of EPO, blood units and hospital days.
              CONCLUSIONS: EPO might become an attractive blood conservation
              strategy for anemic patients at reasonable costs due to the
              reduction in allogeneic blood transfusions, in the modeled

  abstract = "Background and Aims Screening and brief intervention (SBI) is a
              public health intervention that has been shown to be effective in
              reducing heavy alcohol consumption. The aim of this study is to
              estimate the cost-effectiveness of implementing universal alcohol
              SBI in primary care in Canada. Design We developed a
              microsimulation model of alcohol consumption and its effects on
              18 alcohol-related causes of death. Setting The model simulates a
              Canadian population. Participants The model simulates individuals
              and their alcohol consumption on a continuous scale starting from
              age 17 years to death. Interventions The reference case assumes
              no SBI in Canada. The base case assumes screening was conducted
              using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) at a
              threshold score of 8. Additional analyses included evaluating SBI
              using the AUDIT at threshold scores between 4 and 8 or the
              Derived Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) at
              threshold scores between 3 and 7. Measurements The model
              estimates the direct health-care costs, life years gained and
              quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained, which are then used to
              estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of SBI
              versus no SBI. Findings SBI with AUDIT (at a threshold score of
              8) had an ICER of \$8729/QALY. Our results suggest that using
              AUDIT thresholds between 8 and 4, inclusive, would be
              cost-effective for the whole population, as well as for men and
              women individually. Our results suggest that the AUDIT-C would be
              cost-effective at thresholds of 7 to 3, inclusive, for men, women
              and the whole population. Conclusions In Canada, screening and

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Hospital outpatient orthopaedic services
              traditionally rely on medical specialists to assess all new
              patients to determine appropriate care. This has resulted in
              significant delays in service provision. In response, Orthopaedic
              Physiotherapy Screening Clinics and Multidisciplinary Services
              (OPSC) have been introduced to assess and co-ordinate care for
              semi- and non-urgent patients. OBJECTIVES: To compare the
              efficiency of delivering increased semi- and non-urgent
              orthopaedic outpatient services through: (1) additional OPSC
              services; (2) additional traditional orthopaedic medical services
              with added surgical resources (TOMS + Surg); or (3) additional
              TOMS without added surgical resources (TOMS - Surg). METHODS: A
              cost-utility analysis using discrete event simulation (DES) with
              dynamic queuing (DQ) was used to predict the cost effectiveness,
              throughput, queuing times, and resource utilisation, associated
              with introducing additional OPSC or TOMS $\pm$ Surg versus usual
              care. RESULTS: The introduction of additional OPSC or TOMS
              ($\pm$surgery) would be considered cost effective in Australia.
              However, OPSC was the most cost-effective option. Increasing the
              capacity of current OPSC services is an efficient way to improve
              patient throughput and waiting times without exceeding current
              surgical resources. An OPSC capacity increase of ~100 patients
              per month appears cost effective (A\$8546 per quality-adjusted
              life-year) and results in a high level of OPSC utilisation (98
              \%). CONCLUSION: Increasing OPSC capacity to manage semi- and
              non-urgent patients would be cost effective, improve throughput,
              and reduce waiting times without exceeding current surgical
              resources. Unlike Markov cohort modelling, microsimulation, or
              DES without DQ, employing DES-DQ in situations where capacity
              constraints predominate provides valuable additional information
              beyond cost effectiveness to guide resource allocation decisions.",

              multidisciplinary sleep centre, and to use patient flow
              simulation modelling to test solutions that could improve access.
              Discrete-event simulation models of patient flow were constructed
              using historical data from 150 patients referred to the sleep
              centre, and used to both examine reasons for access delays and to
              test alternative system configurations that were predicted by
              administrators to reduce waiting times. Four possible solutions
              were modelled and compared with baseline, including addition of
              capacity to different areas at the sleep centre and elimination
              of prioritization by urgency. Within the model, adding physician
              capacity improved time from patient referral to initial physician

              referral to treatment initiation. Adding respiratory therapist

              a cause of frustration and more importantly, a health concern for
              patients. Waiting time arises when the demand for work goes
              beyond the facility's service capacity. ED service capacity
              mainly depends on human resources and on beds available for
              patients. In this paper, we focus on human resources organization
              in an ED and seek to best balance between service quality and

              time. The problem is also characterized by a multi-stage

              pediatric emergency department (PED) are important in determining
              what aspects of PED activity could be modified to improve patient
              flow, reduce patient waiting times, and increase staff efficiency
              and morale, and thus direct change more effectively. BACKGROUND:
              We report (1) the construction of a Patient Flow Model (PFM)
              using discrete event simulation to test simulated PED staffing
              scenarios that were designed to alleviate the pressures that
              result from increased census and overcrowding, and (2) a
              Physician Scheduling Analysis Tool to assist in physician
              scheduling. METHODS: Arena discrete event simulation modeling
              software was used to develop a model of PED patient flow after
              extensive interviews with PED staff and direct observation of
              patient flow in July 2005. A total of 517 patients were directly
              observed, and all modeled aspects of their interaction with PED
              staff and resources were recorded. Historical demographic patient
              arrival information was combined with observed patient flow data
              to provide simulated patient arrival rates for the PFM and was
              also used to construct the Physician Scheduling Analysis Tool.
              Validation of the PFM was performed by comparing annual simulated
              patient flow data with actual patient flow data. Previously
              determined staffing scenarios were applied to the simulation and
              the resulting performance indicator outputs examined. RESULTS:
              The PFM was validated on model-wide and process-specific levels,
              with excellent validation observed on high acuity-patient length
              of stay and for highly detailed processes such as triage and
              registration. Simulation of the addition of a hospital volunteer
              and a second triage nurse demonstrated reductions in pretriage
              waiting time and the proportion of patients waiting longer than
              30 or 60 minutes for pretriage. Simulation of an extra physician
              shift to the staff schedule demonstrated reductions in length of
              stay for patients of all triage categories. CONCLUSIONS: The PFM
              accurately represents patient flow through the department and can
              provide simulated patient flow information on a variety of
              scenarios. It can effectively simulate changes to the model and
              its effects on patient flow.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Providing patient care and medical education are both
              important missions of teaching hospital emergency departments
              (EDs). With medical school enrollment rising, and ED crowding
              becoming an increasing prevalent issue, it is important for both
              pediatric EDs (PEDs) and general EDs to find a balance between
              these two potentially competing goals. OBJECTIVES: The objective
              was to determine how the number of trainees in a PED affects
              patient wait time, total ED length of stay (LOS), and rates of
              patients leaving without being seen (LWBS) for PED patients
              overall and stratified by acuity level as defined by the
              Pediatric Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS) using discrete
              event simulation (DES) modeling. METHODS: A DES model of an urban
              tertiary care PED, which receives approximately 40,000 visits
              annually, was created and validated. Thirteen different trainee
              schedules, which ranged from averaging zero to six trainees per
              shift, were input into the DES model and the outcome measures
              were determined using the combined output of five model
              iterations. RESULTS: An increase in LOS of approximately 7
              minutes was noted to be associated with each additional trainee
              per attending emergency physician working in the PED. The
              relationship between the number of trainees and wait time varied
              with patients' level of acuity and with the degree of PED
              utilization. Patient wait time decreased as the number of
              trainees increased for low-acuity visits and when the PED was not
              operating at full capacity. With rising numbers of trainees, the
              PED LWBS rate decreased in the whole department and in the CTAS 4
              and 5 patient groups, but it rose in patients triaged CTAS 3 or
              higher. A rising numbers of trainees was not associated with any
              change to flow outcomes for CTAS 1 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The
              results of this study demonstrate that trainees in PEDs have an
              impact mainly on patient LOS and that the effect on wait time
              differs between patients presenting with varying degrees of
              acuity. These findings will assist PEDs in finding a balance
              between providing high-quality medical education and timely
              patient care.",

              purchases or intakes (consumption) (objective 1); Health and

              differences in these outcomes by socio-economic group (objective
              3). METHODS AND FINDINGS: Electronic databases, Internet search
              engines, and bibliographies of included studies were searched for
              articles published in English between 1 January 1990 and 24
              October 2011 for countries in the Organisation for Economic
              Co-operation and Development. Where $\geq$ 3 studies examined the
              same pricing strategy and consumption (purchases or intake) or
              health outcome, results were pooled, and a mean own-price
              elasticity (own-PE) estimated (the own-PE represents the change
              in demand with a 1\% change in price of that good). Objective 1:
              pooled estimates were possible for the following: (1) taxes on
              carbonated soft drinks: own-PE (n = 4 studies), -0.93 (range,
              -0.06, -2.43), and a modelled -0.02\% (-0.01\%, -0.04\%)
              reduction in energy (calorie) intake for each 1\% price increase
              (n = 3 studies); (2) taxes on saturated fat: -0.02\% (-0.01\%,
              -0.04\%) reduction in energy intake from saturated fat per 1\%
              price increase (n = 5 studies); and (3) subsidies on fruits and
              vegetables: own-PE (n = 3 studies), -0.35 (-0.21, -0.77).
              Objectives 2 and 3: variability of food pricing strategies and
              outcomes prevented pooled analyses, although higher quality
              studies suggested unintended compensatory purchasing that could
              result in overall effects being counter to health. Eleven of 14
              studies evaluating lower socio-economic groups estimated that
              food pricing strategies would be associated with pro-health
              outcomes. Food pricing strategies also have the potential to
              reduce disparities. CONCLUSIONS: Based on modelling studies,
              taxes on carbonated drinks and saturated fat and subsidies on
              fruits and vegetables would be associated with beneficial dietary
              change, with the potential for improved health. Additional

              23 studies were included in the final analysis. Majority of the
              studies were US-based. Five chronic disease models included
              Chronic Care Model (CCM), Improving Chronic Illness Care (ICIC),
              and Innovative Care for Chronic Conditions (ICCC), Stanford Model
              (SM) and Community based Transition Model (CBTM). CCM was the

              recommendations and their assumptions regarding important aspects
              of the natural history of COPD. METHODS: A systematic search of
              English articles reporting on the development or application of a
              decision-analytic model in COPD was performed in MEDLINE, Embase,
              and citations within reviewed articles. Studies were summarized
              and evaluated on the basis of their adherence to the Consolidated
              Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards. They were also
              evaluated for the underlying assumptions about disease
              progression, heterogeneity, comorbidity, and treatment effects.
              RESULTS: Forty-nine models of COPD were included. Decision trees
              and Markov models were the most popular techniques (43 studies).
              Quality of reporting and adherence to the guidelines were
              generally high, especially in more recent publications. Disease
              progression was modeled through clinical staging in most studies.
              Although most studies (n = 43) had incorporated some aspects of
              COPD heterogeneity, only 8 reported the results across subgroups.
              Only 2 evaluations explicitly considered the impact of
              comorbidities. Treatment effect had been mostly modeled (20) as
              both reduction in exacerbation rate and improvement in lung
              function. CONCLUSIONS: Many COPD models have been developed,
              generally with similar structural elements. COPD is highly
              heterogeneous, and comorbid conditions play an important role in
              its burden. These important aspects, however, have not been
              adequately addressed in most of the published models.",

  abstract  = "Depression is the most common mental health disorder and is
               recognized as a chronic disease characterized by multiple acute
               episodes/relapses. Although modelling techniques play an
               increasingly important role in the economic evaluation of
               depression interventions, comparatively little attention has
               been paid to issues around modelling studies with a focus on
               potential biases. This, however, is important as different
               modelling approaches, variations in model structure and input
               parameters may produce different results, and hence different
               policy decisions.This paper presents a critical review of
               literature on recently published model-based cost-utility
               studies of depression. Taking depression as an illustrative
               example, through this review, we discuss a number of specific
               issues in relation to the use of decision-analytic models
               including the type of modelling techniques, structure of models
               and data sources.The potential benefits and limitations of each
               modelling technique are discussed and factors influencing the
               choice of modelling techniques are addressed. This review found
               that model-based studies of depression used various simulation
               techniques. We note that a discrete-event simulation may be the
               preferred technique for the economic evaluation of depression
               due to the greater flexibility with respect to handling time
               compared with other individual-based modelling
               techniques.Considering prognosis and management of depression,
               the structure of the reviewed models are discussed. We argue
               that a few reviewed models did not include some important
               structural aspects such as the possibility of relapse or the
               increased risk of suicide in patients with depression. Finally,
               the appropriateness of data sources used to estimate input
               parameters with a focus on transition probabilities is
               addressed. We argue that the above issues can potentially bias
               results and reduce the comparability of economic evaluations.",

              individuals aged $\geq$ 50 should participate in colorectal
              cancer screening. CT-colonography (CTC) is one of several
              screening tests available. We systematically reviewed evidence
              on, and identified key factors influencing, cost-effectiveness of
              CTC screening. METHODS: PubMed, Medline, and the Cochrane library
              were searched for cost-effectiveness or cost-utility analyses of
              CTC-based screening, published in English, January 1999 to July
              2010. Data was abstracted on setting, model type and horizon,
              screening scenario(s), comparator(s), participants, uptake, CTC
              performance and cost, effectiveness, ICERs, and whether
              extra-colonic findings and medical complications were considered.
              RESULTS: Sixteen studies were identified from the United States
              (n = 11), Canada (n = 2), and France, Italy, and the United
              Kingdom (1 each). Markov state-transition (n = 14) or
              microsimulation (n = 2) models were used. Eleven considered
              direct medical costs only; five included indirect costs. Fourteen
              compared CTC with no screening; fourteen compared CTC with
              colonoscopy-based screening; fewer compared CTC with
              sigmoidoscopy (8) or fecal tests (4). Outcomes assessed were
              life-years gained/saved (13), QALYs (2), or both (1). Three
              considered extra-colonic findings; seven considered
              complications. CTC appeared cost-effective versus no screening
              and, in general, flexible sigmoidoscopy and fecal occult blood
              testing. Results were mixed comparing CTC to colonoscopy.
              Parameters most influencing cost-effectiveness included: CTC
              costs, screening uptake, threshold for polyp referral, and
              extra-colonic findings. CONCLUSION: Evidence on
              cost-effectiveness of CTC screening is heterogeneous, due largely
              to between-study differences in comparators and parameter values.
              Future studies should: compare CTC with currently favored tests,
              especially fecal immunochemical tests; consider extra-colonic
              findings; and conduct comprehensive sensitivity analyses.",

  title     = "{Cost-Effectiveness} Analyses of Vaccination Programmes",
  author    = "Kim, Sun-Young and Goldie, Sue J",
  abstract  = "Cost effectiveness is becoming an increasingly important factor
               for stakeholders faced with decisions about adding a new vaccine
               into national immunization programmes versus alternative use of
               resources. Evaluating cost effectiveness, taking into account
               the relevant biological, clinical, epidemiological and economic
               factors of a vaccination programme, generally requires use of a
               model. This review examines the modelling approaches used in
               cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) of vaccination
               programmes.After overviewing the key attributes of models used
               in CEAs, a framework for categorising theoretical models is
               presented. Categories are based on three main attributes:
               static/dynamic; stochastic/deterministic; and
               aggregate/individual based. This framework was applied to a
               systematic review of CEAs of all currently available vaccines
               for the period of 1976 to May 2007.The systematic review
               identified 276 CEAs of vaccination programmes. The great
               majority (83\%) of CEAs were conducted in the setting of
               high-income countries. Only a few vaccines were widely studied,
               with 57\% of available CEAs being focused on the varicella,
               influenza, hepatitis A, hepatitis B or pneumococcal vaccine.
               Several time trends were evident, indicating that the number of
               vaccine CEAs being published is increasing; the main health
               outcome measures are moving away from the number of cases
               prevented towards quality-adjusted and unadjusted life-years
               gained, and more complex models are beginning to be used.The
               modelling approach was often not adequately described. Of the
               208 CEAs that could be categorized according to the framework,
               around 90\% were deterministic, aggregate-level static models.
               Although a dynamic transmission model is required to account for
               herd-immunity effects, only 23 of the CEAs were dynamic. None of
               the CEAs were individual based.To improve communication about
               the cost effectiveness of vaccination programmes, we believe the
               first step is for analysts to be more transparent with each
               other. A clear description of the model type using consistent
               terminology and justification for the model choice must begin to
               accompany all CEAs. As a minimum, we urge modellers to provide
               an explicit statement about the following attributes:
               static/dynamic; stochastic/deterministic; aggregate/individual
               based; open/closed. Where relevant, time intervals
               (discrete/continuous) and (non)linearity should also be
               described. Enhanced methods of assessing model performance and
               validity are also required.Our results emphasize the need to
               improve modelling methods for CEAs of vaccination programmes;
               specifically, model choice, construction, assessment and
               validation.",

  title    = "A systematic and critical review of model-based economic
              evaluations of pharmacotherapeutics in patients with bipolar
              disorder",
  author   = "Mohiuddin, Syed",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic and relapsing
              mental illness with a considerable health-related and economic
              burden. The primary goal of pharmacotherapeutics for BD is to
              improve patients' well-being. The use of decision-analytic models
              is key in assessing the added value of the pharmacotherapeutics
              aimed at treating the illness, but concerns have been expressed
              about the appropriateness of different modelling techniques and
              about the transparency in the reporting of economic evaluations.
              OBJECTIVES: This paper aimed to identify and critically appraise
              published model-based economic evaluations of
              pharmacotherapeutics in BD patients. METHODS: A systematic review
              combining common terms for BD and economic evaluation was
              conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PSYCINFO and ECONLIT. Studies
              identified were summarised and critically appraised in terms of
              the use of modelling technique, model structure and data sources.
              Considering the prognosis and management of BD, the possible
              benefits and limitations of each modelling technique are
              discussed. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were identified using
              model-based economic evaluations of pharmacotherapeutics in BD
              patients. Of these 14 studies, nine used Markov, three used
              discrete-event simulation (DES) and two used decision-tree
              models. Most of the studies (n = 11) did not include the
              rationale for the choice of modelling technique undertaken. Half
              of the studies did not include the risk of mortality.
              Surprisingly, no study considered the risk of having a mixed
              bipolar episode. CONCLUSIONS: This review identified various
              modelling issues that could potentially reduce the comparability
              of one pharmacotherapeutic intervention with another. Better use
              and reporting of the modelling techniques in the future studies
              are essential. DES modelling appears to be a flexible and
              comprehensive technique for evaluating the comparability of BD
              treatment options because of its greater flexibility of depicting
              the disease progression over time. However, depending on the
              research question, modelling techniques other than DES might also
              be appropriate in some cases.",

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: The value of systems science modelling methods in
              the health sector is increasingly being recognised. Of particular
              promise is the potential of these methods to improve operational
              aspects of healthcare capacity and delivery, analyse policy
              options for health system reform and guide investments to address
              complex public health problems. Because it lends itself to a
              participatory approach, system dynamics modelling has been a
              particularly appealing method that aims to align stakeholder
              understanding of the underlying causes of a problem and achieve
              consensus for action. The aim of this review is to determine the
              effectiveness of system dynamics modelling for health policy, and
              explore the range and nature of its application. METHOD: A
              systematic search was conducted to identify articles published up
              to April 2015 from the PubMed, Web of Knowledge, Embase,
              ScienceDirect and Google Scholar databases. The grey literature
              was also searched. Papers eligible for inclusion were those that
              described applications of system dynamics modelling to support
              health policy at any level of government. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:
              Six papers were identified, comprising eight case studies of the
              application of system dynamics modelling to support health
              policy. No analytic studies were found that examined the
              effectiveness of this type of modelling. Only three examples
              engaged multidisciplinary stakeholders in collective model
              building. Stakeholder participation in model building reportedly
              facilitated development of a common 'mental map' of the health
              problem, resulting in consensus about optimal policy strategy and
              garnering support for collaborative action. The paucity of
              relevant papers indicates that, although the volume of
              descriptive literature advocating the value of system dynamics
              modelling is considerable, its practical application to inform
              health policy making is yet to be routinely applied and
              rigorously evaluated. CONCLUSION: Advances in software are
              allowing the participatory model building approach to be extended

  abstract  = "Modelling in economic evaluation is an unavoidable fact of life.
               Cohort-based state transition models are most common, though
               discrete event simulation (DES) is increasingly being used to
               implement more complex model structures. The benefits of DES
               relate to the greater flexibility around the implementation and
               population of complex models, which may provide more accurate or
               valid estimates of the incremental costs and benefits of
               alternative health technologies. The costs of DES relate to the
               time and expertise required to implement and review complex
               models, when perhaps a simpler model would suffice. The costs
               are not borne solely by the analyst, but also by reviewers. In
               particular, modelled economic evaluations are often submitted to
               support reimbursement decisions for new technologies, for which
               detailed model reviews are generally undertaken on behalf of the
               funding body. This paper reports the results from a review of
               published DES-based economic evaluations. Factors underlying the
               use of DES were defined, and the characteristics of applied
               models were considered, to inform options for assessing the
               potential benefits of DES in relation to each factor. Four broad
               factors underlying the use of DES were identified: baseline
               heterogeneity, continuous disease markers, time varying event
               rates, and the influence of prior events on subsequent event
               rates. If relevant, individual-level data are available,
               representation of the four factors is likely to improve model
               validity, and it is possible to assess the importance of their
               representation in individual cases. A thorough model performance
               evaluation is required to overcome the costs of DES from the
               users' perspective, but few of the reviewed DES models reported
               such a process. More generally, further direct, empirical
               comparisons of complex models with simpler models would better
               inform the benefits of DES to implement more complex models, and
               the circumstances in which such benefits are most likely.",

              simulate individual event histories associated with key
              components of a disease process; these simulated life histories
              can be aggregated to estimate population-level effects of

              research questions, methodological improvements in MSM approaches
              have been slowed by the lack of communication among modelers. In
              addition, there are few resources to guide individuals who may
              wish to use MSM projections to inform decisions. METHODS: . This
              article presents an overview of microsimulation modeling,
              focusing on the development and application of MSMs for health
              policy questions. The authors discuss MSM goals, overall

              common in the UK as in other countries worldwide. Computer
              simulation is one approach used for understanding the causes of
              ED overcrowding and assessing the likely impact of changes to the
              delivery of emergency care. However, little is known about the
              usefulness of computer simulation for analysis of ED patient
              flow. We undertook a systematic review to investigate the
              different computer simulation methods and their contribution for
              analysis of patient flow within EDs in the UK. METHODS: We
              searched eight bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE,
              COCHRANE, WEB OF SCIENCE, CINAHL, INSPEC, MATHSCINET and ACM
              DIGITAL LIBRARY) from date of inception until 31 March 2016.
              Studies were included if they used a computer simulation method
              to capture patient progression within the ED of an established UK
              National Health Service hospital. Studies were summarised in
              terms of simulation method, key assumptions, input and output
              data, conclusions drawn and implementation of results. RESULTS:
              Twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 19 used
              discrete event simulation and 2 used system dynamics models. The
              purpose of many of these studies (n=16; 76\%) centred on service
              redesign. Seven studies (33\%) provided no details about the ED
              being investigated. Most studies (n=18; 86\%) used specific
              hospital models of ED patient flow. Overall, the reporting of
              underlying modelling assumptions was poor. Nineteen studies
              (90\%) considered patient waiting or throughput times as the key
              outcome measure. Twelve studies (57\%) reported some involvement
              of stakeholders in the simulation study. However, only three
              studies (14\%) reported on the implementation of changes
              supported by the simulation. CONCLUSIONS: We found that computer
              simulation can provide a means to pretest changes to ED care
              delivery before implementation in a safe and efficient manner.
              However, the evidence base is small and poorly developed. There

              analysis to complement routine tuberculosis (TB) contact
              investigation procedures during an outbreak. METHODS: We reviewed
              hospital, health department, and jail records and interviewed TB
              patients. Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were genotyped. We
              evaluated contacts of TB patients for latent TB infection (LTBI)
              and TB, and analyzed routine contact investigation data,
              including tuberculin skin test (TST) results. Outcomes included
              number of contacts identified, number of contacts evaluated, and
              their TST status. We used network analysis visualizations and
              metrics (reach, degree, betweenness) to characterize the
              outbreak. RESULTS: secondary TB patients and more than 1200
              contacts. Genotyping detected a 21-band pattern of a strain W
              variant. No HIV-infected patients were diagnosed. Contacts
              prioritized by network analysis were more likely to have LTBI
              than nonprioritized contacts (odds ratio=7.8; 95\% confidence
              interval=1.6, 36.6). Network visualizations and metrics
              highlighted patients central to sustaining the outbreak and
              helped prioritize contacts for evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: A
              network-informed approach to TB contact investigations provided a
              novel means to examine large quantities of data and helped focus
              TB control.",

  abstract = "Investigation of contacts of patients with tuberculosis (TB) is a
              priority for TB control in high-income countries, and is
              increasingly being considered in resource-limited settings. This
              review was commissioned for a World Health Organization Expert
              Panel to develop global contact investigation guidelines. We
              performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of all studies
              reporting the prevalence of TB and latent TB infection, and the
              annual incidence of TB among contacts of patients with TB. After
              screening 9,555 titles, we included 203 published studies. In 95
              studies from low- and middle-income settings, the prevalence of
              active TB in all contacts was 3.1\% (95\% CI 2.2-4.4\%,
              I(2)=99.4\%), microbiologically proven TB was 1.2\% (95\% CI
              0.9-1.8\%, I(2)=95.9\%), and latent TB infection was 51.5\% (95\%
              CI 47.1-55.8\%, I(2)=98.9\%). The prevalence of TB among
              household contacts was 3.1\% (95\% CI 2.1-4.5\%, I(2)=98.8\%) and
              among contacts of patients with multidrug-resistant or
              extensively drug-resistant TB was 3.4\% (95\% CI 0.8-12.6\%,
              I(2)=95.7\%). Incidence was greatest in the first year after
              exposure. In 108 studies from high-income settings, the
              prevalence of TB among contacts was 1.4\% (95\% CI 1.1-1.8\%,
              I(2)=98.7\%), and the prevalence of latent infection was 28.1\%
              (95\% CI 24.2-32.4\%, I(2)=99.5\%). There was substantial
              heterogeneity among published studies. Contacts of TB patients
              are a high-risk group for developing TB, particularly within the
              first year. Children <5 yrs of age and people living with HIV are
              particularly at risk. Policy recommendations must consider
              evidence of the cost-effectiveness of various contact tracing
              strategies, and also incorporate complementary strategies to
              enhance case finding.",
