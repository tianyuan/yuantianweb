# **Why should we care about Version Control? **

When writing up a paper with multiple collaborators, we want to avoid the following situation:

# **Core Git Commands and Workflow in Git Shell**

Although you can complete most of the git commands via Git Desktop's GUI without interfering with the Shell, it is often beneficial to know a few key Git commands and core workflow in the Git Shell.  

## Two *basic* commands: `git pull` and `git push`. 

The **`git pull`** can be divided into **`git fetch`** and **`git merge`**. 

## 4-step common workflow in Git 

Assuming you already have the repo on your local machine, then **a common workflow** will have 4 steps:

1. You **`ALWAYS`** need to be sure your local repo is up-to-date with the remote repo. 

```{r eval=FALSE, indent="   "}
#Make sure there are no untracked files.
git status 

#Pull in all the files changed on the remote
git fetch

#Comfirm that all the files are ready to merge
git status

#A final step in pulling the remote changes into local machine
git merge

#A final "git status" to confirm everything is good to go
git status
```
2. With some modifications/changes in your working directory, it is time to inform Git about your new changes using **`git add -A`**.

```{r eval=FALSE, indent="   "}
#Stage all the changed or newly added files in the working directory
git add -A

#Confirm again.
git status
```

3. It's time to **`git commit -m`**!

```{r eval=FALSE, indent="   "}
git commit -m "this is my commit"

#Confirm again
git status
```

4. The final **`git push`** to the remote repository.

```{r eval=FALSE, indent="   "}
git push

# Confirm everything is up-to-date
git status
```

Other commands that might be useful include: **`git branch --list`**, **`git help`**, etc. More can be found in the [Guide to Git Shell](http://dh.newtfire.org/explainGitShell.html) with illustrative figures and tutorials.
