      <description>Functional programming (FP) finally goes mainstream. It is not a new concept, but it is absolutely a complex one for beginners including me. I got exposed to a large set of references, online courses and books, and I will try to organize them in a useful way.
Why Functional Programming (FP)? Why Scala? I enjoyed the talk given by Martin Odersky, which answer the two key questions with very simple code examples.</description>

      <description>Thanks to the Step-by-Step Instruction provided by ALISON PRESMANES HILL and “Blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown”, I was able to create this website. The repository of this website is kept on Git. When I tried to get refreshed on the common Git commands, I came across this wonderful Guide to Git Shell. This post is merely a note on the key common Git commands and core workflow in Git Shell (although you can complete all these actions via Git Desktop without interfering with the Shell).</description>
