      <description>HUGO XMIN Keep it simple, but not simpler XMin is a Hugo theme written by Yihui Xie in about four hours: half an hour was spent on the Hugo templates, and 3.5 hours were spent on styling. The main motivation for writing this theme was to provide a really minimal example to beginners of Hugo templates. This XMin theme contains about 130 lines of code in total, including the code in HTML templates and CSS (also counting empty lines).</description>

      <description>I’m on a trip at the moment, and a friend who generously let me sleep on his couch looked at my small travel backpack and commented on how little I travel with: “That’s impressive,” he said.
I was a little surprised, because though I’ve gotten that comment before, it’s become normal for me to travel with just a small bag (10 lbs. or less, usually), and I have friends who travel with even less.</description>

      <title>Ezhil - How I Learned to Stop Procrastinating, &amp; Love Letting Go</title>

      <description>The end of procrastination is the art of letting go.
I’ve been a lifelong procrastinator, at least until recent years. I would put things off until deadline, because I knew I could come through. I came through on tests after cramming last minute, I turned articles in at the deadline after waiting until the last hour, I got things done.
Until I didn’t. It turns out procrastinating caused me to miss deadlines, over and over.</description>

      <title>Ezhil - Fearlessness: How to Stop Running from Space</title>

      <description>We spend our days filling in every available space, cramming in more tasks, responding to messages, checking social media and online sites, watching videos.
We are afraid of empty space in our lives.
The result is often a continual busyness, constant distraction and avoidance, lack of focus, lack of satisfaction with our lives.
We run from silence. We run from the spaces between tasks and appointments. We run from solitude and stillness.</description>

      <description>You have a to-do list that scrolls on for days. You are managing multiple projects, getting lots of email and messages on different messaging systems, managing finances and personal health habits and so much more.
It all keeps piling up, and it can feel overwhelming.
How do you keep up with it all? How do you find focus and peace and get stuff accomplished when you have too much on your plate?</description>

      <description>Functional programming (FP) finally goes mainstream. It is not a new concept, but it is absolutely a complex one for beginners including me. I got exposed to a large set of references, online courses and books, and I will try to organize them in a useful way.
Why Functional Programming (FP)? Why Scala? I enjoyed the talk given by Martin Odersky, which answer the two key questions with very simple code examples.</description>

      <description>This little book stands the test of time for over half a century. It has numerous hilarious examples regarding the ways that statistics might be biased. I love the author’s comments in the introduction:
The crooks already know these tricks,honest men must learn them in self-dense.
1. Is it a trully representative sample of the studied population?We encountered a key question when interpreting the sample data in the real world:Is the sample a representative sample of the studied population?</description>
