Bauer created a template for writing a reproducible scientific paper. All the files are downloadable from the Shared Google Drive Folder. The version 2 has a simplified version without using the header.tex.\nI read the article, tested his codes and was able to reproduce the article. I ran into a few issues related to TinyTex installization, so just be mindful of the following steps:\n\rinstall.packages(\"tinytex\") and tinytex::install_tinytex() to get the latest version of TinyTex (if bugs presents, re-install with the cmd tinytex::reinstall_tinytex()).\rWhen you knit your paper the first time, you should expect auto-installization of many tex packages and it could take some time depending on the number of tex packages you use in your document.\ralso install.packages(\"kableExtra\") for building common complex tables with customizable styles.\r\r\r3.2 YAML options\rThere are a lot of advanced setting in the YAML header. An example is provided below with some highlighted options:\n\rtex packages: header-includes:\ruse bookdown::pdf_document2: keep_tex: true for pdf output creation.\n\rdocumentclass can be the built-in article or your own customized cls file (e.g., uofsthesis-cs.cls).\rpage setup: geometry, fontsize, and linestretch\rbibliography: put your .bib file in the same directory with your article.\rcitation style: csl.

However, citations within a table is very tricky in the PDF/TEX environment. It is easy to get it working in the HTML environment, but not with pdf, pandoc, and latex.\n\rPandoc Markdown supports a citation extension to the basic markup, like [@krycho].\n\rFor citation in a table in a pdf output file. Rachael Lappan offered a working solution for it.\n\r\r\rI had success with the bookdown text references - I’m not sure if you need to be making a bookdown book or if it will work with the bookdown package loaded.\rIn my case, I defined the references first outside of a code block, e.g.\n\r(ref:studies-table-ref1) Bogaert *et al.* (2011) [@BogaertVariabilityDiversityNasopharyngeal2011]\r\rthen added them to the table\n\rstudies.table$Reference \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;(ref:studies-table-ref1)\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;(ref:studies-table-ref2)\u0026quot;, # etc\r\rAnd kable interpreted them correctly.\n\r\r\r","date":1565913600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565913600,"objectID":"12b4943b1f9938c237a8e53d85062011","permalink":"/post/r-notebook/","publishdate":"2019-08-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/r-notebook/","section":"post","summary":"1 R Setup 101\r1.1 R Packages for Basic R Installation or Update\r1.2 Read SAS sas7bdat data into R\r1.2.1 Use library sas7bdat in R\r1.2.2 Use library haven package in R\r1.2.3 Load Data files in R Studio\r\r\r2 Create a Website using RMarkdown\r2.1 RMarkdown, Hugo, Netlify\r2.2 Blogdown \u0026amp; Hugo - Fix ToC (with Rmd)\r\r3 Write a Reproducible Paper using RMarkdown\r3.","tags":[],"title":"R Notebook","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"\r\r1 Little Statistical Learning Book\r1.1 Model Representation: a function \\(h : X → Y\\)\r1.2 Linear Algebra Review\r\r2 ML Resources\r2.1 Superb Online Courses and Books\r2.2 Other Resources\r\r\r\r1 Little Statistical Learning Book\r1.1 Model Representation: a function \\(h : X → Y\\)\rThis function \\(h\\) is called a hypothesis.\nAccuracy of our hypothesis function \\(h\\) is measured using a cost/loss function.

Why squared loss (but not absolute loss)?\n\rThe absolute value is not convenient, because it doesn’t have a continuous derivative, which makes the function not smooth. Functions that are not smooth create unnecessary difficulties when employing linear algebra to find closed form solutions to optimization problems. Closed form solutions to finding an optimum of a function are simple algebraic expressions and are often preferable to using complex numerical optimization methods, such as gradient descent (used, among others, to train neural networks). –The 100-page ML Book\n\r\r1.2 Linear Algebra Review\r1.2.1 What is the Inverse of a Matrix?\rTo have an inverse, the matrix must be “square” (\\(N_{row} = N_{col}\\)).\nInverse of a value.\rInverse of a matrix.\r* When we multiply a number by its reciprocal we get 1.\r* When we multiply a matrix by its inverse we get the Identity Matrix. \\(A \\times A^{-1}=A^{-1} \\times A = I\\)\nfor a \\(2 \\times 2\\) matrix, the inverse is:\nAccording to the invertible matrix theorem, The inverse might not exsit, if the determinant is zero, such a matrix is called “Singular”.\n\r\r\r2 ML Resources\r2.1 Superb Online Courses and Books\r\rBest FREE Book: An Introduction to Statistical Learning in R\r\rG.
